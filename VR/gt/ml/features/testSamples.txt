Next, seed the tomatoes. Just bust them open and swipe out the seeds with your fingers. Seeds go down the sink. Tomatoes go into a separate bowl for now. I'm not anal about getting every single seed, but I do take my time with this. Seeds make a sauce bitter. #BLOCK# Let the tomatoes sit for a minute. More juice will seep from them. Add that to the pot. To this, I add 1 dash of red pepper flake, 10 dashes of dried oregano, a healthy pinch of herbes de provence, 1/4 cup balsamic, and 1/3 cup sugar. Turn up the heat and let it reduce. This will take a while. #LABEL# +
Meanwhile, I chop up my veggies. 1 Yellow onion, 3 large cloves of garlic, 2 celery stalks, and some carrot. This goes into a pan with a little extra virgin olive oil on LOW heat. I'm just sweating it. My wife hates chunks of carrot, and I tend to keep little baby carrots around for snacking. So I'm just taking those and thinly slicing them with my peeler. It'll get the flavor in there, but will practically melt into the sauce. She'll never even know they're in there. #BLOCK# Veggies in the pot... #LABEL# +
While that's going, I get my wife to crush the tomatoes. #BLOCK# 1 dash of cumin just for the hell of it, and plenty of herbs de provence (seeing a patern here?). #LABEL# -
Close-up. #BLOCK# I'll let that cook together a bit while I boil this tortellini. It should take less than 10 minutes. #LABEL# +
Blend flour, sugar and salt in a large bowl. With a pastry cutter, cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. #BLOCK# Add the water 1 TB at a time, until the dough starts to clump and stick to itself. #LABEL# +
Making the peanut butter:You'll need a food processor, and 2-3 cups of roasted, unsalted peanuts. Dump 'em in a food processor with a generous sprinkling of salt. #BLOCK# Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake your crust for 25 minutes or until lightly golden brown. You can do this a day in advance. When cooled, remove from pan and wrap in plastic wrap until ready to use. #LABEL# -
With a spatula, cream the butter until it is very soft and spreadable. Set aside. Bring the cream to a boil. When it starts boiling, pour over the chocolate. #BLOCK# Finely chop your chocolate with a large heavy knife, and put in a medium bowl. #LABEL# -
Roast in a moderately hot oven (375 degrees) for about an hour. When done, there may be burned sugars around the squash; don't worry. #BLOCK# Scoop out the seeds and most of the stringy stuff, then place cut-side down on a Silpat (or parchment). #LABEL# -
Put the chocolate and 1 tbsp butter into a microwave-safe bowl or cup and microwave for a couple of minutes, until the butter melts and you can swirl it into a smooth chocolate sauce. Pour over the acorn squash custards and return them to the fridge. Now that you have learned how to make acorn squash custard, please be sure to view these othercustard recipes. Also, you will love theseAmerican recipes. #BLOCK# Remove from the oven and let cool until warm. Remove from the cups, invert (so the nuts are on top) and cool in the refrigerator. #LABEL# -
This is a long process (it might even take longer than the squash, depending on the surface area of your pan) so don't rush it. Your patience will be rewarded. #BLOCK# Put them in a pan with 2 Tablespoons peanut oil and caramelize them. #LABEL# -
Add an egg, one at a time, mixing after adding each one. #BLOCK# Add the light golden raisins, cornstarch, and flour. Mix. #LABEL# +
Here is a delicious shot of the outside crust and streusel and walnut topping. #BLOCK# Remove the apple streusel cheesecake tart from oven and allow it to cool on a wire rack. Once it is cool enough to touch the bottom of the tart pan, you can push the bottom of the tart pan up to remove the tart shell. You can then slide the tart off the bottom pan and onto a cake stand. (Optional) Lightly dust the apple streusel cheesecake tart with confectioner's sugar. This is purely for decoration. The tart already has enough sugar in it. Allow for the tart to cool down for an hour or two before serving. Then immediately refrigerate it. This is NOT a dessert you leave out on your counter. #LABEL# -
Toward the end of the 2 (or however many) hours combine the apricots, water, and sugar in a sauce pan on the stove. Bring the mix just to a rolling boil, then turn the heat off and let the apricots cool in the water. Then drain. (this pic was pre-boil) #BLOCK# Heat your oven to 400F and line a baking sheet or two with parchment paper. Pull one ball out of the fridge and roll it out on a dusted counter, or if your counters are like mine, on a dusted piece of parchment paper. Trim the dough so it's square, or at least rectangular. Don't be shy about trimming, with this recipe there's no reason not to mash the scraps back into a 5th ball and use it too. Cut the dough into 2ish inch squares, and place an apricot (that you've patted dry) in the center of each one. #LABEL# +

First, we wrap! Start by denuding our greenery. #BLOCK# Pluck off all the leaves, and strip off whatever bark will easily come off as well. Then cut each twig into two sticks suitable for stabbing pork and soybean - I like about a 45 degree angle on the cut to make it easier to pierce things. #LABEL# +
Start on one end of the curd. Wrap the bacon around itself on the first end to hold it in place; continue to encircle the cake until it is surrounded by pig; put the loose end over the end of the bean cake. #BLOCK# Cut the bacon in half lengthwise, making it the perfect width for wrapping. #LABEL# -
I now season the chicken. I prefer to use my own line of seasonings (See my website link in my profile). Here I am seasoning with Heaven Made Products Extra Spicy All Purpose Seasoning. This seasoning is a Cajun based seasoning that has extra cayenne pepper in it, but it is big on the flavor scale and low on the heat scale, like Popeye's Fried Chicken which uses a cayenne pepper low on the heat scale to add to the distinct flavor of their famous fried chicken. So like Popeye's, this seasoning will not burn your mouth. Additionally, my products are substantially less salty than any of the competition. An alternative, although an inferior one, would be any brand Cajun seasoning. I also season the chicken with Heaven Made Products Steak Seasoning. This seasoning has lots of garlic flavor in it along with black pepper a little onion and my famous base ingredient that works to increase the natural flavors of the dish being cooked. If you are unable to try my steak seasoning, as an alternative you could use a little sprinkling of garlic powder, black pepper and onion powder. #BLOCK# Wrap the seasoned chicken with thin-cut bacon and secure with toothpicks that have been soaked in water for at least 10 minutes. #LABEL# +
Stretch/press to make a little bit bigger and make the edges thinner, and spoon a scant tablespoon or so of filling into the well. Hold bao in one hand, and with the other, pinch two sides shut. #BLOCK# Roll the pieces into balls, and put back what you're not using at the moment in the bowl under the cloth. Make a well into your dough ball, like this: #LABEL# -
Let rest in a warm spot for about an hour, or until they've risen a bit. A puffy, risen bao: When risen, lightly mist the bao with water and using a pastry brush, brush the outside with a beaten egg. Bake in a 350 degree preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, or until lightly golden brown on top. Rotate trays 180 degrees about halfway through baking to ensure even baking. #BLOCK# Your patience is rewarded with a tray of golden brown, perfectly cooked bao: #LABEL# +
Now pick up your cheesecloth and carefully squeeze the curds with your pudgy little hands, extracting a bit more moisture from them. Your queso fresco is ready. Put it in a bowl and get ready to rock. #BLOCK# This next step takes some specialized hardware. We need to separate the tiny curds, which are basically nascent cheese, from the whey, or thin white liquid. In order to do this we will employ cheesecloth - or actually, a reasonable facsimile. I have elected to use a double thickness of sparging bag, a remnant from my home brewing days. Feel free to use any clean, semi- sturdy, very fine mesh cloth to do the straining for you. Put your cheesecloth into a colander, and the whole assembly into the sink. Pour the hot milk mixture into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Realize that your old, faithful digital camera has finally decided to give up the ghost and refuse to deploy its lens when being turned on. Go and get a new one; this should allow ample time for the cheese to separate from the whey. When you return, this is what your cheese will look like: Use a spoon to scrape the fragile little curds into the middle, forming a pile of fresh cheesy goodness. #LABEL# -
It's time for the manchego. Cut off a nice-sized hunk of it. Cut it into 1/4 to 1/2 inch cubes. Drop those cubes of manchego into the bowl with your queso fresco and toss to combine. #BLOCK# Stuff your recent surgical survivors with the tasty mixture of cheeses. Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. You'll want it ready soon. #LABEL# +

Cut the mozarella half of it into 1/2 inch cubes, the other half in as thin of slices as you can manage. #BLOCK# Using real deal cheeses is a must. Grate your own parmesan, and get FRESH mozarella. You can tell the difference. It's wet and sweet like ricotta. #LABEL# -
Add the mashed bananas to the eggs. #BLOCK# Here are the bananas mashed. #LABEL# -
Spoon the banana bread batter into the loaf pans. If you are using 8.5 inch by 4.5 inch loaf pans then they should both be about half full. I'm using 9 inch by 5 inch loaf pans. As you can see I filled one about half way and just put the leftover batter in the other pan. Place the loaf pans in the oven and bake for 35-40 minutes. You will see that the banana bread will shrink from the sides of the pan. Test that the banana bread is done by inserting a metal skewer into the center. If the skewer comes out without anything stuck to it, it is done. If the skewer still has batter on it, continue cooking. You do not want your banana bread to be raw in the middle. If the banana bread isn't done yet but the top is starting to go past a golden brown color, place a piece of aluminum foil over the bread in a tent shape. This will help keep the top from over browning. Once the banana bread is fully cooked, remove the pans from the oven and allow them to cool. Once cool, you should be able to easily remove the banana bread from the loaf pans. Serve your banana bread with butter or cream cheese. You can even toast it to add crunch and some extra flavor. Now that you have learned how to make banana bread, please be sure to view these otherfruit bread recipes. #BLOCK# Here is the finished banana bread batter. #LABEL# -
Once you have done that to all the breasts, season them and then place them pocket side down on top of the corn in the dish. Then cube the butter and place it around the corn, put in a glass of white wine and all the cream. Place the strips of bacon on top of the chicken and season generously #BLOCK# Stuff half a banana into the pocket you made and close it over #LABEL# -
Add in the buttermilk. Slowly beat together until the buttermilk has just combined. #BLOCK# Add in half of the dry mix into the banana mixture. Slowly beat together just until the flour has mixed into the banana mixture. The key to a good batter is to NOT overmix. Once you can't see the dry mix anymore, stop mixing. #LABEL# -
Place the vanilla shortbread cookies or vanilla wafers along the bottom and sides of the dish you want to serve your banana pudding in. I used a 2 quart round baking dish. It has an 8" diameter. However, in order for the ingredients to spread out more evenly I would suggest using an 11" x 7" shallow baking dish. #BLOCK# After a few minutes the mixture will thicken up. It's important to have the right consistency. You don't want a runny banana pudding! You now have banana custard. Banana pudding is actually a 'cooked' custard. The difference between a custard and a pudding is that a pudding uses cornstarch, tapioca, rice flour or other starch as the thickener. When you use egg yolks to thicken a mixture it becomes a custard. Go ahead and remove the saucepan from the heat. If you feel that the mixture may have lumps (a bit of scrambled egg perhaps), go ahead and put it through a sieve over a large bowl. This will remove any of the lumps. #LABEL# -
Pour the banana pudding into your baking dish and spread it out evenly. #BLOCK# Peel the ripe bananas. Slice the bananas in half lengthwise and then slice horizontally. This will give nice bite-sized pieces of banana. Place these bite-sized banana pieces evenly over the top of the vanilla wafers. #LABEL# -
Place the banana pudding into the refrigerator and leave for a few hours. Overnight is best. This will allow the pudding to set. #BLOCK# Pour the banana pudding into your baking dish and spread it out evenly. #LABEL# -
This is the part in the process where you add your spice rub. Coat the meat with it: #BLOCK# Then pour in the marinade you reserved. #LABEL# +
When you're all finished, you're left with a big pile of delicious BBQ pork (note the bone at top of picture that this meat simply "fell" off of). Can you believe all this was $6? Well, OK, maybe more like $15 once you factor in the wood and the fixins, but heck - this is a lot of food. I have successfully fed eight people with this. #BLOCK# And now the pulled pork part, wherein you "pull" the pork apart into shredded, sandwich-ready yumminess. #LABEL# -
Beef: Give the beef a salt and pepper rub and let sit for about 20 minutes. This helps to give it flavor as well as tenderize it. #BLOCK# Heat up some oil in a pan, and add just a little bit of ginger to it, just enough to flavor the oil. Simmer for 5 minutes and add your beef. Sear each side so that the outside is cooked and the inside is rare - about 2 to 3 minutes for each side. Immediately place the beef in some ice water to stop the cooking. Let it sit for a few minute to fully cool down. Mix the soy sauce and saki together. Dry off the beef and let it marinate in the soy sauce and sake mixture for at least 20 minutes. #LABEL# +
Roughly slice it widthwise 3 or 4 times, to get thinner steaks. #BLOCK# Place overnight in the marinade. #LABEL# +
Put the beef on the side, and do the same for the shrimp. Next, stir fry the garlic and ginger until they start to darken and add in the fruit and vegetables. Let them cook for about 3 minutes, then add a little bit more of the marinade. #BLOCK# Slice the steaks into into strips and after getting a wok extremely hot, stir fry them. Add a small bit of marinade and let it caramelize to give the beef some color. #LABEL# -
Get you leeks and use all the white part and 2 inches of the green. Chop. #BLOCK# Chop the onion by first cutting in half, so the root is on each half. Now slice this way, it is really easy to dice onions this way. #LABEL# -
Fill half of a small pan with water and a little salt. Bring it to boil and add the asparagus. #BLOCK# Chop your steak into thin slices (putting it in the freezer for about 20 minutes will make it easier to slice, once the steak is harder). #LABEL# -
Ahh yes, the beer we'll be using. Rogue Brewery's Dead Guy Ale. Happiness in a liquid form. #BLOCK# Now that the veggies are a bit cooler, we can put them in the blender. That's right, you heard what I said, don't pretend like you don't know what's going on up in here. Splash a cup of chicken stock in first, then shovel everything in. #LABEL# +
Stir and add the stock slowly to keep it mixed well. Bring the base up to a boil over medium high heat. Time to add vegetable puree! Return to a boil. I like a little heat behind my beer cheese soup, so I used nearly 3 tsp of white pepper, but you can taste the pepper after 2 tsp. Use phantom hands to drop in the cheese so you don't splash boiling stock all over you! While you're at it, toss in the potatoes. (As a side note, sometimes I cook the potatoes separately, until they fall apart under a fork's lancing. I've found that the cooked potatoes thicken up the soup a bit more than cooking them in the stock.) #BLOCK# About this time, you should cook up the sausage. Stir the soup every minute or so while the meat cooks. When the sausage is done, cut it up and put it on the pot. #LABEL# +
Spoon the blueberries over the cake batter evenly. #BLOCK# Bake for 50 minutes - 1 hour at 350ºF or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the blueberry cake comes out clean. Allow the blueberry cake to cool for 10 minutes before removing the cake from the springform pan. Dust the blueberry cake with powdered sugar. #LABEL# +
In a medium sized bowl, add the flour and baking powder and whisk together. Put this bowl aside. #BLOCK# In a separate large mixing bowl, add the sugar, salt and softened butter. #LABEL# +
Serve your bolognese meat sauce over spaghetti with Parmesan. Yum! The good thing about this is that you can leave it for as long as you need really, just turn it off and resume cooking later. Remember to only use one tin of tomatoes and no herbs for a more authentic sauce. Now that you have learned how to make bolognese meat sauce, please be sure to view these othersauce recipes. Also, you will love theseItalian recipes. #BLOCK# Now turn the heat down so that the mixture bubbles VERY slowly. Leave for 3 hours, adding a little for water if need be. This is about half way through the three hours. #LABEL# -
Making the Glaze:Roughly chop the garlic, shallot, onion, and ginger. Saute in some vegetable oil until tender. #BLOCK# Add the chicken base and a tablespoon of water and mix well. #LABEL# +
Once the fires out... While stirring constantly, add the brown sugar and soy sauce. Once the sugar is dissolved and the glaze starts to bubble, slowly add a cornstarch slurry (take 2 Tbsp of cornstarch and dissolve it in 1/4 cup cold water) until it begins to thicken. #BLOCK# Cooking the Salmon:Slice the skin off the salmon if not already done. Melt the butter in a hot pan and add the fish. #LABEL# +
Simmer for 1 1/2 hours, and season with salt/pepper.

And chop the coriander. #BLOCK# Whilst you're waiting, chop the mango into big chunks. #LABEL# -
And chop the coriander. #BLOCK# When 15 minutes are up, add the beans and warm for a couple more minutes. #LABEL# +
Repeat... #BLOCK# Pour the milk and egg mixture over the first layer to saturate - you do not want the milk level higher than the raisins and sultanas though. #LABEL# -
Now drizzle the butter over the bread. #BLOCK# Lets get started, preheat to 350. Now the first thing you need to do is get your bread in a pan and somehow get butter onto it. You can do this one of two ways, butter the bread then cut it into smaller bits, or break up the bread and then drizzle the butter over it. If you feel the need to have your butter evenly spread on every piece, do it the first way. But this time we will be drizzling it over the already broken bread, if done right you will still be getting butter in every bite. So melt your butter and break up the bread and put it into the pan. You can also go ahead and beat your eggs now. #LABEL# -
Next measure out all of your ingredients and put the Milk, white sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla into a mixing bowl and blend it together. #BLOCK# Then fold in the eggs. #LABEL# +
Mix those up in a bowl and grind on some black pepper. #BLOCK# Put the brie mix in the chicken breasts. Not shown: sprinkle the stuffed breasts with hot Hungarian paprika for color and flavor. Our relatively low cooking temperature and indirect heat means spices on the outside of the meat won't burn. #LABEL# +
Close up of brie stuffed chicken. Now that you have learned how to make brie stuffed chicken, please be sure to view these otherchicken recipes. Also, you will love theseFrench recipes. #BLOCK# Garnish as you like. I did so simply with some sliced radishes and chives. #LABEL# -
While this is cooking, cook your bacon over medium-low heat until cooked and slightly crisped. #BLOCK# Finely and uniformly chop your mushrooms and shallots. Saute in butter or olive oil over low heat for about 20 minutes, stirring only occasionally. #LABEL# -
After about 5 minutes (your mileage will vary) the wings will start to float. Conventional wisdom says they are done at this point. They're not. #BLOCK# After 10 minutes, I'm done. (My fryer was running a little cool. I recall them taking no more than 8 in a commercial fryer.) #LABEL# +
Add chopped tomato. Season with basil and oregano. #BLOCK# Add pine nuts and garlic. Brown. #LABEL# -
Place the pot back on the heat, and add the beans and sausage. Return the soup to serving temperature. #BLOCK# Now get out your handy dandy stick blender and puree the heck out of it. #LABEL# -
Add the squash, yams and stock. Simmer for about 40 minutes or until soft. Let cool for 30 minutes. #BLOCK# In a large stockpot, sweat the garlic and onions (add a couple drops of oil to the pan and spread it; then over low heat and covered, let the onions and garlic cook in their own juices until soft. #LABEL# -
Of course, now we have four beautiful boneless fillets but they have skin attached to them. This just will not do. Lie the fillets skin-side down on the cutting board and insert your fillet knife parallel to the board. Hold onto one end of the skin and while pressing the fillet knife down (it should be bent and pressed up against the board) just work from one end to the other. You'll end up with four nice fillets like this, even if they are currently spotted with bits of scale and whatnot. #BLOCK# Now you'll want to rinse the fillets under some running water in your sink. Just sit them down on a paper towel and pat them dry. #LABEL# +
It's a good idea to throw a dab of butter in the water so the rice doesn't stick to the pot as easily. Makes for fluffier rice too. I add a pinch of salt with herbs to the water as well, just for flavor. #BLOCK# Throw (or pour) the water, butter, and (in my case) salt and herbs in a pot and bring everything to a boil. #LABEL# +
Time to start cooking the sugar! Put the pan over high heat and start it boiling, stirring occasionally until all the sugar is dissolved in the water. Once you see steam rising and the liquid is clear, STOP STIRRING. The syrup is now super saturated with sugar. Any agitation will disrupt it and cause sugar crystals to form, which will result in cloudy candy. It's also at this point you should either brush the sides of the pan down with a pastry brush dipped in clean water or clamp a lid on the pan for a few seconds. Both will wash excess sugar off the sides of the pan. (I actually didn't do either cause I'm lazy) #BLOCK# Technically, you don't even need water, but the added heat convection water provides will boil the sugar more evenly in the crucial beginning stages, where recrystallization is most dangerous. At this point, you should also add your choice of inhibiting agents (either the corn syrup, vinegar or cream of tartar). These help to prevent recrystallization and will give you a better chance at a smooth candy or sauce. During the caramelization of sugar, a process known as inversion breaks down the sucrose (a disaccharide) into the simpler sugars dextrose and fructose (monosaccharides). Once this inversion takes place, it is much more difficult for the sucrose to recrystallize. Adding corn syrup helps give inversion a kick-start by providing a ready source of dextrose. Adding cream of tartar or distilled vinegar add a tiny bit of acidity to the mix, which also aids the inversion process. #LABEL# -
Once your sauce has taken on a smooth texture and a nice brown color, it's been stabilized enough to put in a container and cool in the fridge. It won't be very thick at this point, probably about the consistency of a cream soup, but don't worry, as the sugar cools further, it will thicken nicely. #BLOCK# Let it cool, and serve it up. I personally like to dip apples in it....mmmmm. 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of cream should yield almost exactly 1.5 cups of finished caramel sauce. Now that you have learned how to make caramel sauce, please be sure to view these othersauce recipes. Also, you will love theseAmerican recipes. #LABEL# +
Now add add a few cloves of garlic, a few tablespoons of cilantro, a splash of olive oil, the juice from half a lime, salt and pepper, and your Mexican beer to the meat. Rub it all into the meat (don't poke) and let it marinate in the fridge for about 6 hours. #BLOCK# Now we make guacamole. You'll now need 1 nice, large ripe avocado, cumin, coriander, chili powder, red pepper flakes, 1 good tomato, a shallot (optional), habanero sauce (also optional), and a serrano pepper which is not pictured. I prefer heirloom tomatoes, they're very expensive but infinitely better than typical tomatoes and have much more meat and a much much better flavor. #LABEL# +
Now cover it up and refrigerate it to let the flavors meld until you take out the carne asada to grill. Guacamole tastes best when it's cool, but not refrigerator cold. To prevent browning, put plastic wrap in contact with the guacamole. The browning is caused by oxidation, so cut out the access to oxygen, and viola, green guacamole! Putting in the pit to prevent oxidation is an old wives tale. #BLOCK# 6 hours later, take out the marinated carne asada. Let it come to room temp for 20-30 minutes before grilling. During this time, heat up the grill. You'll want to cook quickly and directly on the hottest setting, or on some hot hot coals. Almost there... #LABEL# +
Wrap the beef up tightly in plastic wrap and freeze until solid. #BLOCK# Rub the marinade onto the beef. #LABEL# -
Thin back out with heavy cream until a thick, pourable consistency. #BLOCK# Mix about 1/4 cup of mascarpone with equal parts of heavy whipping cream, about 1 tsp orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 2-3 TB fresh orange juice, a sprinkle of cinnamon and sugar, and whip to combine. I just tasted and adjusted. I also added a little fresh lemon juice for acidity. #LABEL# -
This dish is very quick to prepare, but takes upwards of an hour to cook. Begin by finely slicing the garlic, chili and onion. #BLOCK# Add to a large frying pan and fry gently for ten minutes. #LABEL# +
Bake in the oven 190 degrees Celsius ( 374 Fahrenheit) for a further 30 minutes. Serve immediately. A very hearty and filling vegetable bake. #BLOCK# Plated:Now that you have learned how to make celeriac and spicy tomato bake, please be sure to view these othervegetable dish recipes.

Start with your limes. Add the zest of 1 lime to a non-reactive (glass or plastic) bowl. Then, roll each lime around on a hard surface while applying pressure with your hands so that they'll yield the most juice. Slice limes in half squeeze them out into a measuring cup and set aside. Prepare your onions onions and peppers by dicing them neatly. Chop up your coriander, and set aside. #BLOCK# Take your lovely piece of halibut (or whatever white fish you decide on... tilapia, flounder, cod...whatever) and get your sharpest knife out and cut off about 1/3 of the filet's worth of fish like so. Cut the fish down again into thin slices. Think sashimi. #LABEL# +
Then, ready your shrimps. If you have a good source for seafood, you can ask them to de-vein them for you when you ask for them. Otherwise, you're going to have to do this yourself. Start by peeling them and then taking a small knife (a paring knife will do) and running the blade down the back of the shrimp. Run the shrimp under cold water while rubbing its back where you've cut and the vein should come free. You can also pull out the vein with your knife as well. Once that's done, cut them in half so you'll have twice as many pieces of shrimp. #BLOCK# Then, take your scallops, which always remind me of marshmallows... and cut them down width wise so they're thinner too. #LABEL# -
Pour the almost clarified butter over the cheesecloth or towel. #BLOCK# Next, put a strainer over a bowl, and lay some cheesecloth in it. I couldn't find my cheesecloth anywhere, so I used a dishtowel. It was of the same consistency, so it worked pretty well. Just don't use a fuzzy dishtowel. #LABEL# -

Add some water or chicken stock and whisk until it boils and become thick. Adjust seasoning if needed. #LABEL# -
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Prepare glaze by mixing the egg and water (I also added a bit of dried pesto mix to mine but that's optional). Brush glaze on loaves/rolls. Pop em in the oven for about 25 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. #BLOCK# Bake until they are a deep golden brown and bottoms sound hollow when tapped, approx 5 - 10 minutes more (I'm at a high altitude so my baking times tend to be longer). If necessary, cover with aluminum foil to prevent over browning. #LABEL# +
When the eggs turn golden brown around the edges, sprinkle on the cherries. The mixture should be thick enough so that they fall about halfway into the foam. Then, sprinkle on the remainder of the cherry juice/Grand Marnier liquid that remains. Sprinkle the remainder of the sugar (2T) on top, and put the entire thing in the oven. #BLOCK# Bake until the dish is puffed up and golden brown. (NOTE: The combination of the cherry juiec and the Grand Marnier will make the eggs turn a bluish color as they cook. This is not a sign of overcooking or rotting, this is just what happens and it is a sign that the dish is pretty much done. Don't worry.) Serve immediately with the mascarpone honey sauce. I chose to cover the plate in a reduction of the canned cherry juice before plating, but this is an optional step.

At this point the chicken should be ready for the dumplings to be added. Pull out your chicken and take off the tin foil. The chicken should be mostly done, but have some spots uncooked. One spoonful at a time drop in some biscuit mix next to the chicken. #BLOCK# Turn the oven temp up to 400F and let it cook for about 20 more minutes. Your finished product will have browned dumplings sticking out above the sauce. You probably want to reheat the broccoli a bit at this point. I just threw it in the microwave and was done with it.

Place the other dough section of top. Turn up the outside edges of the dough pieces and close tightly. Cut cross-shaped hole in the middle of dough. You can beat and egg together and use an egg wash on the dough. This will help give it a golden brown color when it cooks. #BLOCK# Sprinkle with cheese. #LABEL# -
Reduce the sauce to low heat once you get it the way you want. Oh, and add a little salt to it. The bacon will add some, but not enough. Keep stirring it too and adding water as necessary to keep it at the thickness you want. #BLOCK# I used linguine. #LABEL# -
Stir the contents of the bowl well. Make sure the cheese chunks are evenly distributed throughout the mixture. It should look like this when you're done. #BLOCK# Next, we're going to prepare the chicken. #LABEL# +
Cover the mixture in the pot with boiling water and simmer over a medium flame. You'll simmer the vegetables until the lentils are very soft, about 20 to 30 minutes. If the vegetables start to stick or dry up, add more boiling water and turn the heat down. Whilst this mixture is simmering, chop the remaining onions and fry them in a large saucepan over a medium heat in 2 tablespoons of oil. #BLOCK# Make a spice paste with the remaining spice powders and a little cold water. #LABEL# +

Once the Panko breadcrumbs have cooled, add the freshly grated parmesan cheese. #BLOCK# Mix the parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs together. #LABEL# +
Place the chicken breast into the Panko breadcrumb and parmesan cheese mixture and press down gently. Flip the chicken breast and press down gently again. Make sure that the chicken breast is full coated with Panko breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese. If you see any spots that need more coating, you can use a spoon to add some of the mixture onto that spot. Place the fully coated chicken breast back onto the plate. Repeat the last 3 steps until every chicken breast has been coated with the flour mixture, eggs, and parmesan breadcrumb mixture. #BLOCK# Cover a large cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Place a large wire rack on top of the aluminum foil. Spray the vegetable oil spray all over the wire rack. Transfer each of the chicken breasts from the plate to the wire rack. Make sure to space the chicken breasts evenly apart. Once all the chicken breasts have been placed onto the wire rack, it will be quite likely that some of the breadcrumbs have fallen onto the baking sheet that is covered with the aluminum foil. In order to prevent these fallen breadcrumbs from smoking while in the oven, have someone hold the wire rack with the chicken on it while you brush off any of the fallen breadcrumbs into a trash can using a paper towel. Place the wire rack back onto the baking sheet that has been covered with aluminum foil. Spray the top of each chicken breast with a quick blast of vegetable spray. This will help to give the top of the chicken breasts bit of extra crispiness as it cooks. With the chicken on the wire rack, and the wire rack on top of the baking sheet covered in aluminum foil, place it all in the oven and bake at 475º for 15-18 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer reads 165º Fahrenheit when inserted sideways into each individual chicken breast. (Note: If you know that you will be topping your chicken with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese to be placed back in the oven to melt, you can remove the chicken at about 155º-160º Fahrenheit. The chicken won't be fully cooked at that temperature. It will finish cooking while you will be wait for the cheese to melt. Doing it this way will prevent the chicken from overcooking when it goes back into the oven in the next step. Just be sure to wash your thermometer well before using it to test the temperature again in the next step).While the chicken is cooking, heat up the tomato sauce on the stove top or in the microwave. #LABEL# +

If you have a standing mixer, it makes this recipe much easier. Pour your milk into the yeast bowl, add the rest of your sugar and the salt, and mix with your dough hook, or a wooden spoon, and add 5 cups of flour, one cup at a time. #BLOCK# And mix until it's a dough ball. If you're using your hands, you'll have to pull the ball out and knead it for several minutes. You want it nice and solid, and smooth. Wipe some vegetable oil around the interior of a bowl, and throw your dough ball in, rolling it around so it's all covered in oil. #LABEL# +

Carefully pop the balloons by cutting a tiny piece close to the knot and letting the air come out slowly. If you do it too fast and the balloons burst, your bowl may crack. The process of separating the balloon itself from the base may take a couple of minutes. Sometimes I found it easier after a minute or so to put the bowl back in the refrigerator for 5 minutes until the chocolate would cool again. #BLOCK# Refrigerate for 30 minutes #LABEL# -
Sift flour and cocoa powder. #BLOCK# Cream butter and sugar until fluffy. #LABEL# +
Grate up your spices. I buy whole nutmegs and grate them on the finest grater I have. Cardamom comes in green pods that look like this. #BLOCK# And if you bash open the green pods, you'll see lots of little brown seeds. They are so fragrant, and the pre-ground stuff just doesn't hold a candle to this. Grind up those little seeds in a mortar and pestle until you get a fine powder. I used about 3.5 pods. #LABEL# +
Microwave until melted - it helps if you nuke for 15 seconds, then take it out and swirl it around, and repeat a few more times until butter is melted. Add spices, vanilla and sugar. #BLOCK# Chop up your butter and put it in a large bowl (make sure the bowl is microwave safe and actually fits inside your microwave). #LABEL# -

Measure out the chocolate. I used adigital food scale. #BLOCK# Wash and throughly dry your strawberries. If you do not dry them well enough, the chocolate may have trouble sticking. #LABEL# -
Spoon the white chocolate into a snack-sized ziplock bag. Use a scissor to cut the smallest amount you can off of one of the bottom corners of the bag. This should make a very tiny opening. Push the white chocolate down to the corner of the bag that has the cut off tip. If the white chocolate is too hot to handle through the bag then let it cool for a minute. Then gently squeeze out the white chocolate onto the dark chocolate covered strawberries. You want a very thin line of white chocolate coming out. This will allow you to create intricate designs. For a great presentation, serve your chocolate dipped strawberries on a long slender plate lined up in a row. Now that you have learned how to make chocolate covered strawberries, please be sure to view these otherchocolate recipesand thesefruit recipes. #BLOCK# Stir the white chocolate until fully melted. Turn off the burner. #LABEL# -
Remove the pastry cream from the fridge once it is cold. If you had made holes in your eclairs, use a pastry bag to pipe in pastry cream into each eclair using a long filler tube. If you had sliced open your eclairs like I did, just scoop in some pastry cream into each eclair. #BLOCK# Cover the pastry cream with plastic wrap. Be sure that the plastic wrap is pushed right up against the pastry cream otherwise a film will develop on top. Refrigerate the pastry cream. #LABEL# -
Next, wrap the cutout around the mold and seal it by brushing the end with a little bit of the egg white. Here they are, ready for the deep fryer. #BLOCK# Now you want to cut it out into 4" to 5" circles. I don't have a cookie cutter, but the lid from my sugar container (in the top of the picture) is the perfect size, so I use that. After they're cut, you want to make them slightly oval shaped. You can either run them over with the rolling pin or run them through the pasta maker at the same setting. Here are mine: The two that aren't too oval I actually ran through again to make more oval, but forgot to take pictures. Also, if you want you can reflatten the leftover dough and probably get 6 or so shells from one quarter of the dough we made. Yeah, that's a lot of shells. #LABEL# -
Set your deep fryer to somewhere between 360 to 375 (Fahrenheit). Or, if you're like me, heat the oil to that temp. You're going to want to cook them until they're brown and bubbly, which will take 2 to 3 minutes. This was my first time deep frying anything, so one thing I learned about deep frying on a stove is that once you put the stuff in, the temperature will drop a lot. Anyway, they'll look like this in the pot when they're done: #BLOCK# Take them out and let them cool on some paper towels. They only need a few minutes to cool while handling. While they're cooking, I actually prepare the next batch of shells. Then I can, I just slide off the shell and put the new ones one there. The shells should just slide off. They may need a bit of work. They're pretty strong, so don't worry too much about manhandling them. The big bubbles may burst, but it's just air anyway, so it doesn't matter. #LABEL# +
Pour the cream into a bowl. Add the creme de cacao and vanilla extract, then sift the powdered sugar and cocoa powder over it. #BLOCK# You have two choices now.

After you've got that nice and rolled out, you want to put the filling in. Take your butter for the filling, and melt it. Once it's melted, use a pastry brush and brush it over the entire surface of the dough. Then, take your cinnamon and brown sugar, mix them and break up the brown sugar clumps, and sprinkle that evenly over the dough. Leave about 1/2" of one of the long sides filling-free, because that will be the end of your roll, and then it will stick better to the other dough. My dough here has some extra brown sugar sprinkled on it, simply because I thought it needed more. Also, with respect to cinnamon, if you can get it, get the Vietnamese cinnamon. Much more potent than your average grocery store cinnamon. #BLOCK# Then it's time to roll. Start at a long edge, and roll up, like so: #LABEL# +
Use a butter knife to mix everything up until you have a soft dough. #BLOCK# Soft Dough: #LABEL# +
I found this bit very difficult. Take half of the dough and roll it out to make a 50cm * 20cm rectangle. The recipe now says to cut this in half lengthwise, and then to cut each strip into 5 parts, but I found I only had enough dough for 4. Then, cut a line of three 2cm slits along the middle of each part. Make three more rows of slits either side of the middle row, but offset them to produce a lattice effect (think how bricks are offset in buildings). #BLOCK# Use this time to prepare the filling, by mixing the peel, brown sugar, and lemon rind together. Now is also a good time to get the oven on, at 220C (425F). #LABEL# -
Dump some of the filling mixture in the centre of each square. Keep in mind that this is only half of the dough, and you are going to be doing the same with the rest in a minute. #BLOCK# Another difficult bit. Fold the sides up to enclose the filling and squeeze the seams shut. Then turn the whole thing upside down, shove it on a greased baking tray, paint the top with egg, and sprinkle on a little brown sugar. Repeat all this for the other half of the dough to make another 8 or so cakes. Bake for 12-15 minutes. #LABEL# +
Add the coconut to the mixture. Pour the mixture into the mold and bake in a bain-marie for 30 minutes or until the center is set. #BLOCK# Allow the Cream Caramel to cool to room temperature and chill in the fridge for 4 to 5 hours. #LABEL# +

The Filling:Mix the eggs and 3/4 cup of the sugar. Add the milk, half and half, 3 Tbsp vanilla, a tsp of salt, and 1 cup of the flakes. Pour the mixture into the hot pie crust. Baking the Pie:Wrap aluminum foil around the edges of the pie crust so it doesn't burn. Bake at 350F for around 30 to 40 minutes. You want the center to be almost solid. Allow to cool at room temperature for 2 hours. #BLOCK# The Topping:Take the remaining cup of coconut flakes and bake off at 325F for about 7 to 8 minutes, or until slightly browned. Mix the heavy cream, remaining sugar, and the remaining vanilla together until the cream can hold its peak. #LABEL# +
Place several spoonfuls of rice dough in a 10” banana leaf and fold tightly. Then place that in a steaming pot for 20 minutes. Remove from the steamer, unfold the banana leave, and cut the dough into bite size pieces. Then sprinkle sugar on top and spread a spoonful of coconut cream on it. Serve while it is hot and enjoy! #BLOCK# Soak and wash the banana leaves in hot water. This will soften the leaf and make it easier to fold. Meanwhile, in a sauce pan, add coconut milk and bring to boil – At the same time stirring to constantly to make sure the coconut milk doesn’t stick to the bottom. Let coconut milk to cook down until all the liquid is gone and all that is left is cream and oil. TNow, to make the rice dough: Boil the regular milk in a pot. Right as the milk begins to boil, add the rice flour while stirring constantly. You want to mix the milk and the rice flour together to create the rice dough. Once it has come together, turn off the heat. #LABEL# -
Melt the chocolate on a bain marie aka double boiler. Whip the cream to soft peaks and refrigerate for about 10 minutes. Whisk together the egg yolk and the sugar for 2 minutes. Bring the honey and Sabroso to a boil. #BLOCK# While whisking the eggs continually, slowly add the sabroso. Continue to whisk until cooled. Whisk the eggs into the chocolate. Quickly whisk in the whipped cream. Pour the ganache into a mold (I took a pepsi can, cut the top off and cleaned it out; this way I can just cut the can down the side and remove it when set). Prop in your fridge at a slight angle and let it set for an hour. #LABEL# +

Open the crab meat and put it in a bowl. A note on canned crab meat. Canned crab meat is not as good as fresh crab meat. It is, however, one of the great hidden bargains at your local grocery store. That can cost $1.79 versus about $8 dollars for the same amount of fresh lump crab meat. If you live on the coast where you can get the fresh stuff cheap, go for it, for the rest of us canned crab meat makes a great alternative. #BLOCK# Rub the steaks down with olive oil on both sides, including the skin side.

1) Over a medium heat, Saute shallots in butter until translucent 2) In a separate pan, warm up your stock with the saffron. It doesn't need to boil. 3) Add rice, saute 2 minutes. 4) Add wine, cook until all the wine is absorbed. 5) Once the wine is absorbed, add the stock one ladlefull at a time and stir. You'll know when you need to add more stock because stirring will be really hard and the rice will start to sticking to the bottom of the pan. 6) Don't stop stirring. Ever. 7) Once the rice is at the desired consistency (somewhat soupy and no longer al dente), add the cream and cheese. 8) Stir until thickened. #BLOCK# Risotto:1 C arborio rice 1 C dry white wine (Cline Viognier represent) About 4 C chicken stock pinch saffron 2 TB cream 3 TB shallot, diced 2 TB butter Parmesan to taste salt and pepper #LABEL# -
I hope you've peeled your garlic and onion! Now roughly chop the onion and crush the garlic (if you're a poor college student, like me, with no budget and three pieces of kitchenware for cutting and eating, you accomplish this efficiently by placing the flat of a blade atop a single clove and tapping it slightly with a hammer until the garlic is crushed): Next, pour the vegetable oil into the large frying pan and let it heat for about half a minute or so. Fry the crushed garlic and onion for5 minutes: #BLOCK# You'll want to sprinkle teaspoonfuls of water into the pan between batches maybe, depending on your cookware. Don't use oils or anything else.

Arrange biscotti with their sides down on a baking sheet and bake until crisp but still slightly soft in the center (about 8 minutes). This is key since you do not want to eat a biscotti that it is so hard you inevitably have to dip it in milk. #BLOCK# Cut biscotti diagonally using a serrated knife. Cut into 1-inch-thick slices. If you cut them too think, they may dry up and end up too hard. Careful when you cut since the biscotti may break. #LABEL# -
Now, we can't very well use a bowl that's already full, can we? Take a melon baller and scoop out nice big round chunks of dragonfruit flesh. Save it for the filling; it's quite tasty. #BLOCK# Hey, what gives? These are the supposed to be the same fruit, but one's white on the inside and one's red! Cool, isn't it? Those black specks are seeds, by the way, and have a crunch/texture very much like kiwifruit seeds. #LABEL# -
Now, peel, seed and chop your tomatoes. Tip:to peel, score the tomato with a few Xs in the skin, place in very hot or boiling water for 30 seconds, then put in a bowl of ice water. The peels will come right out. Slice in half horizontally and with your finger, scoop out the wet seeds, leaving only the pulp. Slice into thin wedges. Set aside. #BLOCK# Now slice your pepper into thin strips. Tip:To easily core and slice, stand your pepper and take a slice out of the side. #LABEL# +
Add peppers and cook for a minute. Then reduce heat to medium, move everything over to the side, and add the egg. #BLOCK# Let cook, then as well as you can, flip it over and finish cooking it. Then with a fork or a flat wide spatula, shred or break up into bits. Add the chilies and mix well. Now we're ready for the tomatoes, the basil, the sauce and the noodles. #LABEL# +

Now I was to lazy to make crust, it was to late at night for me to run to the market so I brainstormed and I decided to take a splash of oil ( I used olive) and I greased the pie dish with that and then I sprinkled Parmesan Cheese over the oil to give it the floured over look. This is yummy and wont burn and gives the quiche a crust effect without crust and it doesn't burn and it lifts out of pie dish easily. #BLOCK# Start preparing your Brie by slicing it in strips. Brie is so soft and you can't grate it, this is the only way. Once your done doing that put it aside with the egg mixture and mushrooms and onions. #LABEL# -
Once the mushrooms are softly sauteed, add the chicken broth. #BLOCK# Add the wine. #LABEL# +
Now you have a choice to make based on how long you want to wait until your chili is done. The first option is to use a dutch oven if you are willing to heat up your oven and wait 2-2.5 hours. The other option would be to use a pressure cooker. When you use a pressure cooker you drastically reduce the time it takes to break down the meat and infuse flavors. You can have chili ready to eat in as little as 30 minutes. I went with the pressure cooking method. Either in your dutch oven or in a 6 quart pressure cooker pot over medium-high heat, brown the beef and pork (not the chorizo) in 3 separate batches so as to not overcrowd the pan which would steam the meat instead of browning it. Place the browned meat onto a plate while you brown the next batch. #BLOCK# Here is a photo of just a small amount (there was much more) of the grease that strained out of the chorizo. You don't want all this in your chili! #LABEL# -
Add the browned beef and pork. If you used chorizo, add it in as all the fat should now have strained off. #BLOCK# Add the chili powder, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato paste, salsa, and cumin. Stir well. #LABEL# -
Sprinkle on some sugar. I'm using plain sugar, but you can use brown sugar instead. Vanilla sugar is my favorite. #BLOCK# Torch it. #LABEL# +

This gives us time to prepare the chunky bits. Pour some (how many is really up to taste) roasted edamame into a plastic bag and put it on something non- fragile. Terminate with moderate prejudice.

this. It will still jiggle around in the middle, but that's fine. Cover this and refrigerate overnight, for at least 12 hours, but as long as you wish, up to 24. The longer it stays in the fridge, the firmer it will be, and you want it nice and firm. #BLOCK# Now, let's make our pears, starting about 30 minutes before you want to serve your flan, as they should be warm, it's a nice contrast with the cold flan. Here's what you'll need; 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 ripe pears, unpeeled, quartered, cored 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1/4 cup sour cream 1/8 teaspoon salt If you don't have an ovenproof skillet, then use one skillet to cook the pears on the stove-top, and then make sure that you get everything from the skillet into your pan you intent to use in the oven. Melt your butter in the skillet over medium-high heat, and throw in your pears, one of the cut sides down. Cook for about 4 minutes, until they're nice and brown on the side in the butter. Turn to the other cut side, and cook for about another 4 minutes. Pour in the maple syrup and bring to a boil. If your skillet is oven-proof, stick it in the oven at 375. If not, use a spatula and get everything from the skillet into the pan, and make sure the pears are skin-up. Cook for about 25 minutes, until the pears are soft and brown. #LABEL# +

From here on out you will be moving fairly fast. All of your pieces are very small, and they will cook very fast. You MUST pay attention or your stuffing will be ruined. On a medium flame, heat up a non-stick skillet. Once it's hot, pour some canola oil in the pan. You'll need about 1 Tbsp. worth, but this is one of those things you feel after you get the hang of it. I forgot to take a picture of this next part, but luckily you need only to rely on your nose. You will dump the onions and ginger (bowl #2) into the skillet, and keep it moving over a medium heat until you can smell the fragrance of the scallion and ginger mixing. The scallions will begin to wilt, but other than that you need to trust your sense of smell. This next part is very important. We will be par-cooking the shrimp. This means we're going to Partially cook the shrimp. It will be done on the outside, and slightly unfinished on the inside. This is so that it will finish cooking when you cook the wonton. Dump bowl #1 into the skillet, with everything else still in it from before. Keep it stirring, and move it quickly. #BLOCK# When all of the shrimp has JUST turned pink, quickly dump in the sauce mixture, mix it in very well, and take the skillet off the heat. Then mix enough water into your corn starch - which you intelligently set aside so you'd be ready - to completely liquefy it. Pour this into your skillet and mix it in fast. If you take too long to stir it in it will get clumpy and gooey. This is when you need to pour in the sauce: #LABEL# +

Then sprinkle some powdered sugar on it to counter-act the sour lemon juice, and you have a gorgeous pancake: Just be careful not to add too much lemon if you don't like sour stuff. Now that you have learned how to make german egg pancakes with lemon, please be sure to view these otherpancakes recipes. Also, you will love theseGerman recipes. #BLOCK# Once your pancakes start to brown around the edges, and curl away from the sides of the pan, they're probably ready to come out (the small pan in the picture from the oven is pretty close to done). Make sure the middle isn't still soggy though, that sucks. GRAB A HOT MITT and pull these guys out. Make sure you remember to keep that hot mitt handy, because seeing a pan on the stovetop, you don't always think to have a hot mitt on. I grabbed the 375 degree handles on my pans with no hot mitt at least 4 times making these things. If you have something standing by to keep them warm, shove them in there (a toaster oven may do the trick) or if you're serving them up immediately, slap them on a plate. Add some lemon juice, I like a lot. #LABEL# -

Pour some peanut (or other high smoke point) oil into the wok. Split a thumb- sized piece of ginger and put it in the oil, then crank up the heat. Woks require pretty much the highest heat you can manage. I'll stop short of Saint Alton's admonition to get yourself a propane-powered jet engine to cook on, but as long as you keep an eye on the wok, the more heat the better #BLOCK# Let the ginger fry until it's nicely browned. This will infuse the oil with ginger, adding another dimension of flavor to the finished dish. While the ginger fries, make a slurry from one tablespoon corn starch and two tablespoons water. Add it to your sauce, stirring constantly for a minute or two. Now you can let it steep for a while, or immediately drain through a sieve. #LABEL# +
Oil up a cookie sheet, oil the taters, and put them cut-side down on the sheet. Toss them in a 350 degree oven for 20-40 minutes. They should be fork- smooshy, which is beyond fork tender.

Add the still-warm barley. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently. The caramel is likely to seize up into chunks when the barley is added, but dedicated stirring and cooking will cause it to relax and coat each grain of barley. Once most of the caramel has applied itself to the barley, move to a baking sheet. If you let this cool, it will get somewhat soggy. For that reason I recommend assembling the dessert immediately after candying the barley. If you need to do this in advance, a quick refresh in a hot pan will restore some of the crunch (but also dry out the barley somewhat). #BLOCK# Candied Barley:Cook the barley in a rice cooker or over the stove. Typical stovetop cooking time is around 45 minutes to an hour. Once the barley is cooked (but preferably still warm), put the sugar into a saute pan over medium-high heat. Shake frequently, and begin stirring as the sugar liquefies. Once it browns a bit, add the butter and stir until the butter has melted and the caramel is fully liquid. Add the vanilla extract and stir to combine. #LABEL# -

But whatever floats your boat, so long as you get eight equally sized little balls of dough out of it. Spread more flour out onto your surface - no, more. Lefse loves getting stuck when you roll it out, it's infuriating. The best way to avoid it is to flip the dough over every time you take a roll on the rolling pin, flick a little more flour under it, and then roll the other side. Always keep your rolling pin well floured, too. You want really thin pieces here, absolutely no thicker than your average flour tortilla, otherwise they won't cook all the way through and will taste a little doughy. They should work out to be about nine inches diameter. #BLOCK# Once you have all eight pieces rolled out, heat up your frying pan or griddle or whatever and grease it slightly if it isn't non-stick. Non-stick is great for this purpose, though. Flip one of the uncooked lefse into the pan and quickly unfold any creases that might have happened with the spatula. You only turn lefse once, and you do it when you see air bubbles forming under the lefse like I circled in blue here: #LABEL# +
First, make the crab cakes. Shred your crab in a bowl. Mince a stalk of lemongrass - remove the tough outer leaves until you get to the tender innards- and add to crab. Add about 1/4 cup mayo, about 2 tsp lime juice, salt and pepper, and a few TB of panko. #BLOCK# Form into firm patties, coat both sides in more panko bread crumbs, and put in the fridge to firm up. This picture does not show firm patties, mold them firmer than this, or they will fall apart! #LABEL# +
Making the Sauce: Just so you know what you're getting into, we're going to be making our fish base with lots of rosemary to give it sort of a piney flavor, and then boil away all the extra liquid and reduce it into a modified version of fish veloute sauce. Saute the lobster shells and legs, tomatoes, onions, 6 sprigs of rosemary, tarragon, bay leaves and carrots in olive oil until the carrots are tender. Add 2 quarts of water to the stock and simmer for an hour. #BLOCK# Using a fine mesh strainer, strain the stock into a pot, press on the refuse in the strainer to get every last drop of flavor. Strain a second time back into the original pot. Boil on medium heat until stock is reduced to about 1 1/2 cups (about an hour to hour and a half). #LABEL# +

Ingredients:- 24 oz (3 pkgs) Cream Cheese - Graham Crackers - 6 tbsp (3/4 stick) Butter - 1 cup Sugar (for cake) - 3 tbsp Sugar (for crust) - 3 Eggs - 1-3/4 cups Sour Cream - 2 tsp Vanilla Extract - Zest of one Orange - 3 tbsp Orange Juice Concentrate - Food coloring (optional)If you'd like to make the Mandarin Orange topping, you'll also need:- 2 cans (11 oz each) Mandarin Orange Slices in light syrup - 1/4 cup Apricot Jam - 1 tbsp Orange Juice (use your concentrate for this) #BLOCK# First, set your oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, cube up your cream cheese (this is the only thing you'll need the knife for) and set it aside in your large work bowl. Doing this first will give it a chance to soften. You can even place the work bowl in a larger bowl or pan with warm water in it to help things along. Also, place the orange juice concentrate in a bowl of hot water to help it thaw. #LABEL# +
Then, drizzle in the melted butter, about 1 tbsp at a time, and mix it with a fork at first, then your hands. #BLOCK# You'll know the crust is well mixed when you can take a handful of it, make a tight fist, and end up with a well-formed clump. It should crumble slightly when you break the clump in half. Pour it out of your work bowl and into the springform pan, pack it down tightly and evenly, and place in the 300 degree oven for 10 minutes. This will help firm up the crust and prevent too much batter from soaking into it later. #LABEL# +
After the first hour has gone by (and you've opened the door four times, now) go ahead and keep the door closed, baking it for one more hour. I've seen a lot of cheesecake recipes that bake for a much shorter time than this. Trust me, the cake will come out perfect. Also, it may "rise" a bit in the oven -- don't worry, it'll settle back down when it cools. How to tell when the cake is done? It will be lightly browned around the edges, but stil soft and jiggly in the middle. A toothpick inserted near the edge will come out clean, but near the center will come out with cake batter on it. And here it is, very slightly brown around the edges (the brown doesn't show up as well against orange), a little wobbly in the center. Carryover will take it the rest of the way. When it gets to this point, remove it from the oven, and place on a cooling rack for one hour. Do not place it directly in the fridge! The heat that it's hanging onto will finish cooking the middle of the cake, without overcooking the edges. Once an hour has passed, place the cake in your fridge for at least six hours before removing from the pan. #BLOCK# And here it is, finally out of the pan. The orange layer doesn't show up as well in the picture, but it looks really nice laying on a plate. The edges are a little rough and ugly, though, so first we'll cover that up. #LABEL# +
Put the 1/4 cup of Apricot Jam and 1tbsp of Orange Juice in a small sauce pan over medium low heat. (Why Apricot jam? Because orange would be too overpowering. Apricot has a sweeter, less acidic flavor that won't overpower the mandarin orange slices, or the cake.) While that's melting, take a moment to drain the mandarin orange slices and pat them dry with a paper towel. #BLOCK# Once the jam and juice mixture has melted, coat the top of your cheesecake with it. A pastry brush is excellent for this, of course. You could use a basting brush, but be careful with the stronger bristles it has. If you don't have either of these, just pour it on top of the cake and carefully smear it all over the top with a soft rubber spatula, a spoon, or your (clean!) fingers. Don't worry if it drips over the edges. Once it's well coated with the glaze, start putting the orange slices in concentric circles on the top of the cake. The slices are really small, but there's a lot of them. It'll be fine. Cover the entire top of your cheesecake with them. Letting this chill in the refrigerator for at least a half hour before serving will allow the glaze to firm up and really hold the orange slices onto the top of the cake, though it could certainly be served immediately. Extra Bonus Content! -- Here are a few more ideas that I just came up with right now. 1) Want an extra fancy presentation? Get an extra can of mandarin orange slices, and prepare 1-1/2 times the glaze. Drain and dry them like the others. Put your cheesecake on a platter big enough to serve it on, and arrange the extra slices around the base of the cheesecake. Drizzle the extra glaze on the plate around the cake. 2) Don't want the mandarin orange topping? Try this. Get some chocolate (baking chocolate would be best because of the firmness and size of the chunks, but you can use a Hershey's bar) and put it in the freezer while your cake is in the fridge overnight. When you're ready to make the topping, zest another orange, and shave the chocolate bar. (Using a knife to shave it will yield the best looking results, though you could use the grater.) Liberally sprinkle the top of the cake with the orange zest and chocolate shavings. 3) The mandarin orange topping goes great on plain cheesecake, too. Or try it with other fruit, like strawberries (you can use strawberry jam for this since they aren't really acidic), blueberries, or cherries. You can take the easy way out by using canned pie filling, or make it yourself with fresh ingredients. You can also try other flavors for the cheesecake itself, though this may require more experimentation. And there you have it! My favorite part of this recipe, by the way? It's pretty cheap. Assuming you already have the basic baking supplies (sugar, butter, eggs, vanilla extract) and not counting the cost of the cake pan. Blocks of cream cheese can often be had for $1 on sale, and you can use store brand graham crackers. The cost of the whole thing is less than $10, and you will never find a whole cheesecake this good for that price.

Add the 2 tbsp of cilantro to the bag. Next it's time for the garlic. Grab four cloves (NOT heads), proceed to take the skin off like so: And for the love of god, don't hit the knife too hard, it only takes one firm strike with the heel of your hand, you don't have to drive the knife through the cutting board and into the counter. Also, if you hold the knife so that it is not parallel to your cutting surface the garlic will have a tendency to shoot out from under and ricochet off random stuff in your kitchen. #BLOCK# After you have your 4 cloves with no skin left, proceed to mince them like so: #LABEL# +
Slide the garlic into the bag with the growing marinade. Now add 2 teaspoons of the dried basil (or oregano in my case). This ingredient is pretty hard to screw up, and any standard Italian/Mediterranean herb mix will do just fine. #BLOCK# Next we sweeten it up a little bit with 3 tablespoons of brown sugar: #LABEL# +
Next add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of fresh ground pepper. Now that we have all the ingredients for the marinade in the ziploc bag, close it up and shake it around to mix up the contents. Then reopen it and add the chicken thighs (make sure to trim any excess fat beforehand). Close it back up, but make sure to keep a bit of air in there (i. e. don't close it like you're going to be sticking this in the freezer and don't want the chicken to get freezer burn). Shake the bag around once more to distribute the marinade over the chicken. #BLOCK# Now, try and find a spot in your hopefully crowded fridge for the marinade to sit. It took me almost 10 minutes of rearranging stuff to get a nice flat spot. So, now we let the marinade sit for 4 to 4 1/2 hours in the fridge. Make sure to check in once every 45 minutes to hour and shake around the bag some more, flip it over, redistribute the contents, etc. #LABEL# +
Variant 2: Sushi StyleThis is a better method for the short, wide pieces of ginger. Lay a single piece along the top of the melon, like a piece of sashimi goes onto rice.

The meat was arranged neatly on the bread to allow for a maximum protein per carbohydrate ratio. 2 slices did it, I believe, as the meat was not thinly sliced or shaved. We used pre-sliced Asiago and applied it to the sandwiches like so, however it should be mentioned that the waxed paper squares separating each slice should be removed unless you enjoy extra cellulose with your meals. #BLOCK# The bread was then sliced with a serrated blade (hint: if you don't have a proper bread knife, you can use a steak knife) and arranged on the Silpat for construction. Mustard was applied, although not too liberally as it doesn't melt during cooking like butter would. Too much mustard makes for a soggy sandwich, you see. #LABEL# -

Once you actually start cooking, everything is going to be done fast so now is a good time to get everything prepared. Get yourself a bowl and put the egg and a little water in it and whisk it up. Next, get a plate or a piece of parchment and put a cup of flour on it. Place that to the left of the bowl. Get another plate / piece of parchment and put your panko on it. Place this to the right of the bowl. You should have (from left-to-right) flour, beaten egg, panko. #BLOCK# Mix all the sauce ingredients except the vegetable oil together in a bowl.

Add 1/3 tsp of salt. #BLOCK# Get your frozen pie crust and place it on a cookie sheet. This is essential for when your pie boils over (and if you don't have a deep dish crust, it will). Burning sugar sends a nasty smell through the entire house and could even give the pie a slight odor after it's done. Please use a cookie sheet. After mixing your filling until it can't be mixed anymore, pour it into the pie shell. #LABEL# +
In either case, when your pie still looks like this: IT IS NOT DONE YET. See all that tan-colored "foam"? That needs to mostly go away before you take it out of the oven. This is all of the air bubbling out of the pie so that it may have a smooth, caramely texture. At least I assume so. Another way of checking the doneness of the pie is this: take the cookie sheet and move it a bit. Did the pie jiggle like a Jello mold? Are the pecans bulging over the top? If so, wait another few minutes before taking the pie out of the oven. When the pie has fell back to a normal position and you start seeing clear bubbles rise from the filling, chances are it's done. #BLOCK# Stick it in a preheated 350 degree oven for 45-60 minutes. Now, if you used a smaller crust, you'll only need 45 minutes. But if you used a deep dish shell like I did, you'll need the hour. #LABEL# -

Also, you will love theseAmerican recipes. #BLOCK# Bake for another 25 minutes, or until the internal temp of the roast reaches about 150 degrees for a nice, juicy, pink medium pork (put the pork about 5-10 minutes earlier if you like your pork well-done). At this point, turn off the oven, remove the roast and place on a large platter, tent with foil and let stand for 5-10 minutes. You can leave the potatoes in the oven to keep them warm, just keep an eye on them to make sure they don't burn. After the pork has set, remove the string, and plate the potatoes around the roast. Bring to the table to carve and serve. #LABEL# -
That way, it makes really attractive curly strips of mint. Add these to the mix, with about 2 tbsp of juice squeezed from the lime. A dash of salt, and you have mango salsa.

When they get to this stage, start fishing out the obviously done ones. Nobody likes burnt potato chips, and the time it took to slice the things you don't really want to waste any. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and shake off any excess, then place onto paper towels to blot up the rest of the oil. #BLOCK# Put in a big bowl and prepare to season. Of course you can season the potato chips with whatever you wish, but for these I wanted to try and recreate the chicken &amp; thyme flavor crisps which I love so much. Where do you obtain chicken flavoring? easy - stock (bouillon) cubes! Strangely this tastes almost identical to the chicken flavored crisps I can buy in a store. I just crushed down a cube, added some hot chili powder, some dried thyme and a little onion salt. Of course you could just keep it old school and add salt, but you're pretty much only limited by your imagination here. Just put all your cooked potato chips into a big bowl and use a spoon to add the desired amount of flavoring. How much depends on how much you like the flavor being added, toss the chips around a bit and shake the bowl to get the excess to settle to the bottom. Take a sample chip every now and then to judge if you've got the right amount. #LABEL# +

Figure out what kind of dish you want to make your tiramisu in. I am making them in covered casseroles, but that's only because they'll be the easiest to take to work. You can do them in a glass dish, or a springform pan. The only change will be how you arrange your ladyfingers. Dip your ladyfingers, one at a time, into your cooled espresso. There's a science to this, as you want them to be soft but not falling apart. If you are using soft ladyfingers, brush the coffee on with a pastry brush. If you are using hard like I am, I find two quick dunks in does the trick. Be sure the whole ladyfingers is moist, and let the coffee drain out for a few seconds before laying them in your dish. Figure out your pattern that will make the most sense, and make one layer of dunked ladyfingers: #BLOCK# See how it makes my spoon stand up? It should be thick enough to do that. #LABEL# -

But how will you get your hot jars out of the boiling water? With your handy jar lifter. #BLOCK# First you need to boil your jars and the band piece of your lids to sterilize them. If the recipe had a long processing time, you could get away with just running them through the dishwasher and taking them out while they're hot. But our recipe only calls for 5 minutes of processing time, so a 10 minute boil it is. I like these small jars a lot because I can sterilize and process them in my 4 quart pot. Anything bigger requires a bigger pot. #LABEL# -
All right, now that everything's clean and ready, add the root beer to the sugar: #BLOCK# And your flat lid pieces can go in a small pan of simmering water: Don't boil these - you can ruin the sealing compound. #LABEL# -

With your fingertips, place a flat lid on your jar, centering the red ring on the rim, like so: #BLOCK# Set a band on top, and turn until it is finger tight. This means turn it until you feel resistance, and then give it about another half turn. Don't go crazy tightening it; you just need to keep the lid on in the boiling water. Repeat with your remaining jars. #LABEL# +
I put a small round wire rack in the bottom of my pan, because putting the jars directly onto the stainless steel bottom could crack them. The water should come up about an inch over the tops of the jars: Let it process in the boiling water for 5 minutes. #BLOCK# I had to do mine in two batches because you can't really crowd the pan. Then you remove them to your towel covered cutting board with your jar lifter, and let them sit to cool for at least 8 hours. In the first few minutes, you may hear popping noises. That's good! It means the vacuum inside is pulling the lids down so tight they're flexing concave. After 8 hours, press on the lid with your thumb. It should be concave downward. If it won't pop back up, you've got a good seal. This jam will be liquid when stored at room temp, but will firm up to jelly consistency in the fridge. This is a great introductory recipe to canning. It's pretty cool to look in your pantry and have jars of homemade goodness that are shelf-stable. I've even started canning homemade salsa, but instructions for THAT will have to wait until it's tomato season again. In the meantime, try this recipe!

Salmon CroquettesWhen the salmon is done, put it in a mixing bowl sans skin. Add 1 full egg (or 2 egg whites), 1 cup of fresh sourdough bread crumbs, 1/4 cup minced green onions, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. The resulting salmon croquettes will be savory, and warm to the palette at any temperature. Stir the mixture until it forms a gooey paste. If you need to absorb liquid, add more sourdough crumbs. Form into patties, and place them on a baking sheet. #BLOCK# You know, I have a very nice, unused roll of parchment paper, but I didn't use it. I'd recommend it. Do as I say, not as I do.

Place the vegetables in a roasting pan (it doesn't have to be fancy, a pyrex baking dish or even disposable foil pan will work) and toss with olive oil, thyme, and about 1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper. After the chicken is brined, pull out the pieces, pat dry and season each side with salt and pepper. Place the chicken on top of the vegetables and roast at 450 degrees until the chicken is ~175 degrees inside, about 30-45 minutes. #LABEL# -
Rinse out the pot, and put on med-high heat. Add the cabbage and broccoli, plus a couple tablespoons of water, and stir like for 1 -2 minutes. Note we are not using oil... thus you must stir like crazy. #BLOCK# Since we only have one pot, plate your rice. Pro Tip: rinse out one of your Tuna cans to mold the rice and gain extra presentation points! #LABEL# -
Dump in the rest of the veggies, cook for another minute or two (you should be feeling the burn in your stirring arm by now) and then add 1/2 a cup of water and 1 Tbspn of chili powder. Use your spoon to scrape up anything burned to the bottom of the pan. Keep this cooking, stirring not as much as before, but still semi-frequently, until the water is almost all cooked away. This steams the veggies a bit, and makes the cooked but still crispy. #BLOCK# At this point, dump in the Tuna and any extra marinade that is left in the bowl. Add black pepper to taste, stir to combine, reduce the heat to low, and let it go for another 5 minutes or so. #LABEL# +
Add the vegetable oil to a pan over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and salt and stir around the pan. Reduce the heat down to medium and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the onions become soft. #BLOCK# Take off the lid and put it aside because you won't need it anymore. Add the chopped garlic and chili powder to the onions and stir for no more than a minute. #LABEL# +
Once the dough is smooth, wet a paper towel with some cooking oil and rub down the inside another large mixing bowl. This will prevent the dough from sticking. Add the dough into the new bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Place the mixing bowl somewhere warm (about 80 degrees Fahrenheit) for one hour to allow the dough to rise. What I did was put the bowl in the oven set at its lowest setting with the door slightly propped open. If your home temperature is around 80 already then just leave it the bowl on the counter. #BLOCK# When the dough has doubled in size, you can use a plastic dough scraper to remove the dough from the bowl and onto a lightly floured surface. If you don't have a scraper you can just dust your hands with flour and use them instead. At this point, now would be a good time to pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. #LABEL# +

First, get rid of the oil you used to fry the meat, and be careful about it. Add one tablespoon of oil to the wok and swish it around a bit. Dump in your peppers and stir-fry them on high heat, shouldn't take more than a minute or two. #BLOCK# You can put the pineapple in at the same time if you want, but the oil doesn't take too well to the moisute, so I'd recommend adding the sauce and then the pineapple. I use maybe 6-8 chunks, it just depends on how much you want. Keep stirring, don't let the sauce burn. Should take less than a minute or so. You can see some of the stuff is slightly scorched, that's what happens when you stop stirring to take pictures. #LABEL# +

While that was boiling happily away, I added the rice and corn to the vegetables and squirted a healthy serving of sriracha over the whole concoction. The camera decided to do a flyby! #BLOCK# I let the tandoori liquids reduce down for a few minutes before serving, piping hot. Tandoori Chicken with Sweet &amp; Spicy Stir Fry is not the prettiest coloring of a meal, but it was tasty! The tandoori was smooth and meaty. The stir fry was sweet at first, then had quick soy flavoring and then WHAM spicy that sticks to the back of your throat! I dipped the chicken in sriracha, because I'm a sucker for hot stuff. I love meals like this because it's pretty healthy for heart-conscious people like myself. I use very little soy sauce and no salt, so the sodium is pretty low. The yogurt I made the tandoori with was non-fat, and I don't even put a lot of vegetable oil in. Brown rice is great for you, and how about them veggies?

First, get your ingredients together. This is a really fast-paced meal near the end, so I recommend having everything measured and handy. Also, take the shells and legs and tails off the shrimp, and cut the turd out of the back. Heat up your chicken broth (enough to cover your orzo with some to spare). I used the whole box shown above for a double-order or orzo, so you'll need less. Once it's boiling, add your goya packet, your tomato paste and some salt and pepper. If you have saffron it would be a good addition, but I didn't have any and wasn't paying for just this meal. Cook the orzo like you would pasta. It will absorb most of the liquid. If it dried out a bit, a little olive oil and tomato paste will take care of it. #BLOCK# After about 5 minutes of cooking your orzo, sprinkle your shrimp liberally with kosher or sea salt and pepper. Squeeze a lime over (both halves), stir well and let sit for 10 minutes. #LABEL# +
(Yes, I'm using a souffle dish - I'm making this at my fiance's and he has limited kitchen gadgets.) Add flour to a mixing bowl... #BLOCK# Now for the dough.

Take a litre of water, put it in a saucepan, and bring it to the boil. Then, add 4 or 5 teaspoons of soup paste, and stir it in. The water should turn red, and a little oily, like you see in this picture: Okay, that's not a very good photo, but you'll get a more accurate idea of what it should like from upcoming photos. Anyway, if the soup tastes spicy enough for your liking, that's good. If it's not spicy enough, add the paste a teaspoon at a time until you're happy. #BLOCK# Once you've done that, add a little bit of lemon juice. #LABEL# +
Beat your eggs and milk and pour the mixture into a large frying pan. Then get a lid on top of it. #BLOCK# Keep stirring your other two pans. Your butter, milk and flour should now be forming a cream. #LABEL# +
Add your sauce. #BLOCK# Once your cheese has melted, get that omelette onto a plate somehow. The best way is probably to cut it in half and use a fish flip. Luckily I had two fish flips and was able to do it all in one go. After that, you can unfold your omelet. Nice and colorful now, isn't it?! #LABEL# -
Do this with each tomato and then cut them into quarters so to remove their seeds and cores. Don't worry about getting every single seed out. #BLOCK# Then, crush the tomatoes by squishing them through your fingers or if you are fortunate to have one, a tomato mill. Alternatively, you can dice them on a cutting board. Once completed, put them back into your pot along with 250ml of chicken stock. #LABEL# +
When the onions are soft and translucent, put in the tomatoes and the juice that leaked onto the pan. Mash them until it looks like a chunky puree. #BLOCK# Let that simmer until almost all the water is reduced and you're left with essentially tomato paste. It'll look about like this. Now, if you're not a fan of the rustic look, or are serving picky eaters or children, now is the time to run that through your food processor, or even better, an immersion blender. I personally like the rustic look, so we're leaving it. #LABEL# +

Now it's time to get microwaving. I started the turkey off by itself for a few minutes so that it would get some color before stewing in the rest of the casserole concoction. Once that was done, I added it to the casserole dish with the yams and apples. Cook for about 5 minutes on high. Once the yams start softening up, you'll want to add your brown sugar and butter: #BLOCK# Once you're done chopping up produce, you can cut up your raw turkey.

Serve it and enjoy! This is enough to easily feed a few hungry mouths around, or one really hungry person. As always, make sure to strain the stir fry well before placing in a serving dish, otherwise the bottom will sit in liquid and turn to mush before you get to it. Note, if anyone is wondering, I am using a cutting board. After dealing with too many wooden boards I finally just purchased a tempered glass cutting board. Not only does this make it easier to clean in the event you spill something, but its much less prone to retaining bacteria.

One, the broccoli should start to shrink together, the onions should become less crisp, and the asparagus is at the point of no return. You can keep cooking if you really want to infuse the taste here, but you do so at the cost of mushy asparagus. The general rule of doneness still applies here, taste a few of the vegetables and see what you think. #LABEL# -
Mixed: #BLOCK# Add the crushed tomatoes and beans, I used regular baked white beans here. My store used to have these really neat tinned 5-in-1 bean mixes from Heinz, but either they have stopped making them or my store won't buy any, because I can't find them anymore. #LABEL# +
Now for the beer! Pour about half a can into the pan, but be careful or you'll turn it into a soup. From what I've gathered you're supposed to use really dark beer for this, like Guinness. However, I used a very good Finnish beer called Karhu which is paleish brown. #BLOCK# The creme de la creme. Add two tablespoons of creme fraiche and stir around quickly so it doesn't coagulate, this really balances out the flavors and tones down the heat of the jalapenos. Of course, if you want it super mega hot you can skip this. And, if you want this dish to be a bit leaner, you can use cooking yogurt for this, which works just as well. #LABEL# +
Chop the garlic and get ready to fire up the bacon. On the right side of the stove, we get the soup base started. The bacon fat will provide the oil needed to start these vegetables cooking.

If its too dry, throw a little more melted butter in there, like a half TBS. It should now resemble wet sand. #BLOCK# Now dump it into the pan. #LABEL# +
Blend, stop, scrape until combined and homogeneous. Almost there! #BLOCK# Add vanilla, salt and white chocolate, along with the heavy cream. Stop, you're done. Give it a final scrape because there may be bits at the bottom of the bowl. #LABEL# +
Pour it into the springform pan with the foil on the outside. Add hot tap water OUTSIDE of the tin foil until it comes halfway up the sides of the pan. Notice the cheap roasting pan. I will not be using this any more since it does not allow the springform pan to sit flat and so the cheesecake will bake lopsided. One thing helps is to have wide foil, like at the Costco. With it, you won't get any leakage into the cheesecake. Regular sized foil does not work as well. #BLOCK# Add vanilla, salt and white chocolate, along with the heavy cream. Stop, you're done. Give it a final scrape because there may be bits at the bottom of the bowl. #LABEL# -
Now, add four cups of blackberries. #BLOCK# Mix your ingredients gently in the bowl. Try not to smash the berries, just make sure everything's evenly distributed. Don't worry if it looks too dry, the berry juice will liquefy everything when it cooks. #LABEL# +
Dot the top with thin butter shavings. #BLOCK# There, that looks about right. #LABEL# -
Some volcanic activity reported, Captain! #BLOCK# Bake in the oven for 35 to 40 minutes at 425 degrees. I put the pie onto a pizza pan to catch juices. #LABEL# -
Once cool, you can cover with aluminum foil, and place in the refrigerator to chill. #BLOCK# Set it on a cooling rack, and allow to cool. #LABEL# -
Mmmm mmmm, time for pie! The first piece is always the hardest to remove. #BLOCK# Once cool, you can cover with aluminum foil, and place in the refrigerator to chill. #LABEL# -
Add the cream - reduce. Add the buttermilk and bring back up to a simmer. #BLOCK# Deglaze with the sherry. Add the stock and reduce. #LABEL# -
Strain. Return to heat. #BLOCK# Take your cooked pancetta... #LABEL# +
Also, lightly coat your largest pan/skillet with the olive oil, heat it over medium-high and toss in the shrimp. If you have uncooked shrimp, wait until it's opaque and orange here. Don't overcook them because they'll be in the pan a long time. #BLOCK# Next we cut off the tails of the shrimp. #LABEL# -
Slice up some Kalamata Olives and Goats Milk Feta Cheese. #BLOCK# Lay the phyllo dough out in layers. Each layer needs to be brushed with butter. I used 5 layers. #LABEL# +
Place some zucchini slices, kalamata olives pieces, a bit of feta cheese and a touch of sun dried tomato spread in the middle and on top of the phyllo dough layers. #BLOCK# Pinch them shut and bake them at 350F for 10 minutes, then 375F until they are golden brown. #LABEL# +
