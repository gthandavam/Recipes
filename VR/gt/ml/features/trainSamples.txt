First things first, I drain the tomatoes. I'm saving the juice, however. If I just used this juice in the sauce, it'd be watery. So I'm going to reduce it down with some other flavors and use it as the base. At this point you may be notice that this recipe looks an awful lot like Alton Brown's Pantry Friendly Tomato Sauce. I guess great minds think alike. Mine's a little different though, plus it has meat. #BLOCK# Next, seed the tomatoes. Just bust them open and swipe out the seeds with your fingers. Seeds go down the sink. Tomatoes go into a separate bowl for now. I'm not anal about getting every single seed, but I do take my time with this. Seeds make a sauce bitter. #LABEL# +
Let the tomatoes sit for a minute. More juice will seep from them. Add that to the pot. To this, I add 1 dash of red pepper flake, 10 dashes of dried oregano, a healthy pinch of herbes de provence, 1/4 cup balsamic, and 1/3 cup sugar. Turn up the heat and let it reduce. This will take a while. #BLOCK# Meanwhile, I chop up my veggies. 1 Yellow onion, 3 large cloves of garlic, 2 celery stalks, and some carrot. This goes into a pan with a little extra virgin olive oil on LOW heat. I'm just sweating it. My wife hates chunks of carrot, and I tend to keep little baby carrots around for snacking. So I'm just taking those and thinly slicing them with my peeler. It'll get the flavor in there, but will practically melt into the sauce. She'll never even know they're in there. #LABEL# +

I now season the chicken. I prefer to use my own line of seasonings (See my website link in my profile). Here I am seasoning with Heaven Made Products Extra Spicy All Purpose Seasoning. This seasoning is a Cajun based seasoning that has extra cayenne pepper in it, but it is big on the flavor scale and low on the heat scale, like Popeye's Fried Chicken which uses a cayenne pepper low on the heat scale to add to the distinct flavor of their famous fried chicken. So like Popeye's, this seasoning will not burn your mouth. Additionally, my products are substantially less salty than any of the competition. An alternative, although an inferior one, would be any brand Cajun seasoning. I also season the chicken with Heaven Made Products Steak Seasoning. This seasoning has lots of garlic flavor in it along with black pepper a little onion and my famous base ingredient that works to increase the natural flavors of the dish being cooked. If you are unable to try my steak seasoning, as an alternative you could use a little sprinkling of garlic powder, black pepper and onion powder. #BLOCK# Boneless, skinless chicken breasts thawed and brought to room temperature. You can use any part of the chicken, especially the thighs, drumsticks and breasts. Leaving the skin on adds more flavor. If I leave the skin on I add an additional minute of cooking on the skin side to crisp the skin and render more of the fat. Here is the chicken trimmed of the excess fat. Even when leaving the skin on I will trim the excess fat since it reduces flare ups and it reduces the amount of calories in the dish. #LABEL# -
Wrap the seasoned chicken with thin-cut bacon and secure with toothpicks that have been soaked in water for at least 10 minutes. #BLOCK# I heat the grill on high for 10 minutes. Then I turn off all of the burners and I spray a small area of the grill with oil (Pam) and place a piece of chicken on that spot and I repeat this until all the chicken pieces are on the grill. Then I turn the burners back on high for a minute to sear the bacon and chicken. I'll then reduce the flame to a medium flame to control flare ups. #LABEL# +

Don't forget to remove all of the toothpicks before diving into this dish!Now doesn't that look good? Options to this dish would be topping the bacon wrapped chicken with your favorite cheese right before removing from the grill and giving the cheese time to melt. We use pepper jack cheese. Additionally, you could add a number of veggies to the top of the chicken prior to topping with cheese, like: onions, mushrooms, any pepper like bell peppers, jalapeno's, pabalano etc. All of these can be grilled on the side and when done placed on top of the chicken then add on the cheese.

This next step takes some specialized hardware. We need to separate the tiny curds, which are basically nascent cheese, from the whey, or thin white liquid. In order to do this we will employ cheesecloth - or actually, a reasonable facsimile. I have elected to use a double thickness of sparging bag, a remnant from my home brewing days. Feel free to use any clean, semi- sturdy, very fine mesh cloth to do the straining for you. Put your cheesecloth into a colander, and the whole assembly into the sink. Pour the hot milk mixture into the cheesecloth-lined colander. Realize that your old, faithful digital camera has finally decided to give up the ghost and refuse to deploy its lens when being turned on. Go and get a new one; this should allow ample time for the cheese to separate from the whey. When you return, this is what your cheese will look like: Use a spoon to scrape the fragile little curds into the middle, forming a pile of fresh cheesy goodness. #BLOCK# "But wait!" you say, "I don't HAVE any fresh cheese!" Well then I guess we're just going to have to MAKE some!How to make cheeseWe'll need a quart of whole milk and some lemons. Pour the milk into a non-reactive saucepan. Aluminum is not non-reactive, but anodized aluminum is apparently fine for this. Juice two lemons using your favorite Juice Extraction System. Strain the juice to get rid of pulp and seeds, then set it aside for a moment. Throw a thermometer into your saucepan, and heat the milk to 180 degrees (F), stirring constantly. Once you're up to temp, reduce the heat to Low and pour in the lemon juice. Immediately stir. You will notice your milk has mysteriously curdled, and bits of milk protein are clinging to your whisk. Do not panic, this is normal. Hold the milk at 160-180 degrees for five minutes or so, stirring it frequently. Make sure it doesn't scorch or get too hot. #LABEL# -
To start the salsa, take one of your two tomatoes. Cut it in half top to bottom, then remove and discard the seeds and core. Dice this tomato up into what you feel is an appropriate size. I shoot for about 1cm squares. Put it in a bowl with a little kosher salt to await the rest of the ingredients for your salsa. #BLOCK# Now pick up your cheesecloth and carefully squeeze the curds with your pudgy little hands, extracting a bit more moisture from them. Your queso fresco is ready. Put it in a bowl and get ready to rock. #LABEL# -
Off we go to the grill! Throw the other tomato, the tomatillos, and the chilies on the grill and give them a good roasting. The best part about roasting the tomato is that it peels really easily - frequently while still on the grill. The tomatillos should change color, becoming more brown and less green, as they cook. The chilies need to have a fairly even black tone to them to make peeling easier. When everything is done, put it in a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a plate to let the skins steam off. #BLOCK# To start the salsa, take one of your two tomatoes.

I recommend gloves for handling chilies like this. Cut them in half lengthwise, then slice delicately under the seed body to remove. The more careful you are to not remove much of the underlying membrane, the more heat will be left in the chile. Cut up the chilies and put them in the bowl with the raw tomato. Continue the dis-assembly with the roasted tomato. All those juices are great flavor, so be sure to save them. Take off the tomatillo skin and chop roughly. It'll mostly fall apart anyhow.

And now, to the rellenos. Back to the grill, and take your jalapenos with you! Same treatment with grilling and peeling. But we need these guys whole, so don't seed them the same way. Instead, make a long incision down one side of each chile. Sometimes a chile will crack or split during the roasting process; if that happens, just use that as your opening. Now, carefully so you don't rip open the chile any more, pull out the seed body. If you need to use a small knife to scrape/cut the guts out, feel free.

Unfortunately, I only had purple kale on hand when I made this kale chip recipe. Purple kale has a purple rib and veins with really curly leaves. Next time I make this I'll definitely use normal green kale. If you make kale chips, please use normal green kale. Remove the kale leaves from the rib (the main vein that runs from top to bottom). You can just rip the kale leaves off the rib. For larger leaves, just tear them into large chip sized pieces. If any kale chunks have any very thick veins on them, try to remove the veins as the fiber will just make the kale chip chewy. #BLOCK# Pour cool water into a large bowl or plastic kitchen tub.

You will more than likely require 2 trays as I did. Be sure to give each kale chip enough room. They should NOT be stacked on each other, otherwise they might steam cook. See image to the left. Turn on your stove fan if you have one to pull out the smell of the baking kale as it isn't very pleasant. Kale falls under the cruciferous vegetable family, and they release a sulfur odor when cooked. Bake at around 300º Fahrenheit for 8-10 minutes. Ovens vary in temperature and cooking times though so DO check your oven temperature if you can with an oven thermometer to make sure your oven gauge / regulator works correctly. Your kale chips will burn extremely quickly. You want GREEN kale chips, and want to aim for not seeing any brown at all. If they go brown they go bitter and taste horrible. The best thing to do would be to stay close to your oven and around 8-10 minutes poke a few leaves with a fork. If your hear them crunch / crackle like a crispy chip, they are done. It's a very fine line between good and ruined, so be very watchful. If they don't crunch when you poke them, give them another minute and test them again.

While this was happening I had had the sense to put my sausages in the oven, here they are in all their chopped up porky glory. #BLOCK# At this point I must have forgot to keep up taking pictures of this masterpiece in the making, so we've skipped ahead a bit. Basically all that's happened is the pasta and sausage was dumped in a big mixing bowl with about 3 cups of grated sharp cheddar, half a red onion (couldn't find any more) a liberal dose of garlic granules and onion salt, some hot chili powder, a bit of paprika, a few squirts of mustard and milk. Poured it into the white dish, didn't quite fit so I used a large spoon to squash it until it did. #LABEL# +
Not entirely happy with what I had, I called a friend who is a chef and he recommended covering the top with breadcrumbs and cheese so it'd go all crispy after baking. Not wanting to mess around making breadcrumbs, I searched through the back of the cuboards and found ready made breadcrumb like stuff... I think its for making onion rings and the like, but who cares. Poured as much as that on as I deemed necessary and grated yet more cheese on top.

Place muffin cups in a muffin baking ban. Using a spoon or preferably and ice cream scoop, fill each muffin tin about 75% full. Bake at 400° F for 20-25 minutes. Your oven temperature may vary (get an oven thermometer), so I would start checking on them after 17 minutes or so. When they look done, insert a toothpick in a few and if it comes out clean, they are done. Take them out and allow them to cool. As soon as the tins are cool enough to touch, remove each banana nut muffin from the baking pan. Tip:If you need to make a second batch to use up any remaining banana nut muffin batter, add about 1/2" of water to any empty muffin areas in the muffin pan. This will keep the heat evenly distributed and prevent the pan from getting too hot and burning the banana nut muffins.

Place the milk mixture into a heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir frequently. Be sure to scrape the sides and bottom well to prevent scorching. For this recipe I used pure vanilla extract. However, you could instead use about 2.5" of a vanilla bean for a more intense vanilla flavor. If you are going to use a vanilla bean, now is the time to add it as it will need time to steep to release its flavor. Just slice it open lengthwise and use a knife edge to scrape all the seeds out.

You don't want a runny banana pudding! You now have banana custard. Banana pudding is actually a 'cooked' custard. The difference between a custard and a pudding is that a pudding uses cornstarch, tapioca, rice flour or other starch as the thickener.

Place the vanilla shortbread cookies or vanilla wafers along the bottom and sides of the dish you want to serve your banana pudding in. I used a 2 quart round baking dish. It has an 8" diameter.

Use a spatula to scrape the whipped cream onto the banana pudding. For a nicer presentation you can then add a few slices of banana and insert some extra vanilla wafers into the whipped cream. To prevent the banana slices from browning, coat the banana slices in the lemon juice before placing them on top of the whipped cream. Serve and refrigerate any leftovers. Note: Instead of making whipped cream, you could make a meringue using the leftover egg whites. Just whisk the whites on high speed with the same amount of sugar until stiff peaks form.

The first key to good enchiladas is a good sauce, it should be a chili based sauce, not tomato (although I do use a bit of tomato concentrate to richen it up) I normally use Anchos or New Mexicos but today I went with Pasillas, being darker the color of the sauce is less red and more brown, next time I'll probably go back to the lighter chilis just for the more vibrant color but the sauce is still very good. First things first, seed, stem and roughly chop your chilies (5-6 good sized chilies). Then grind them up, if you don't have a spice grinder a blender works fine. #BLOCK# Sautee half an onion and 3-4 cloves of garlic then add in your chilis.

Appetizing as it is, we must move on. I took about 4 tablespoons of bacon fat from the pan and put it into a tall pot. Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in with it and whisk in the 8 tbsp of flour.

Bring the base up to a boil over medium high heat. Time to add vegetable puree! Return to a boil. I like a little heat behind my beer cheese soup, so I used nearly 3 tsp of white pepper, but you can taste the pepper after 2 tsp. Use phantom hands to drop in the cheese so you don't splash boiling stock all over you! While you're at it, toss in the potatoes. (As a side note, sometimes I cook the potatoes separately, until they fall apart under a fork's lancing. I've found that the cooked potatoes thicken up the soup a bit more than cooking them in the stock.) #LABEL# +
Turn off the heat and pour in the beer. This is going to give off an amazing beer aroma for a little bit, don't be afraid. Let it happen. #BLOCK# About this time, you should cook up the sausage.

You can also use dried beans for even less money, but you'll need to soak them overnight or your soup will be crunchier than you want it to be. Start by frying your bacon over medium heat. What you want to do is cook it so its done but not too crispy as its going to give the soup a meaty base. As far as bacon goes, the stuff I used was quite lean and thick so I didn't have much fat to drain. Other bacon I've cooked in the past will yield a lot of fat, so use a bit of caution. Once it's cooked through, remove it from the pan and drain its fat until you've got just enough to saute up your onion and garlic, which should be chopped up nicely. #BLOCK# While that's going on, open up your cans of beans and drain them in a collander.

Get your broth ready by preparing it in a 6 liter pot.

If you like a sweet and crispy muffin top, go ahead and sprinkle the tops of the batter with the decorating sugar or turbinado sugar. Place your muffin tray in the oven and bake for about 30 minutes at 375º Fahrenheit, or until the blueberry muffins are golden brown in color and a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Let the blueberry muffins rest for a few minutes and then use a toothpick or cake tester to circle around the outside of each muffin to allow it to easily break free of the pan. You should then be able to easily lift the muffins out of the pan. The crumb structure of the muffins are a bit tighter than what a usual muffin would be. It's a bit closer to the tender texture of a cake due to the creaming of the butter and sugar. Be sure to eat your blueberry muffins within a few days. The outside of the muffin will get softer the longer they are left covered. They will still taste just as good though.

The buffalo wings should really be served RIGHT THEN, hot. But since I was going to a party I let the wings cool on a wire rack. Any attempt to "keep them hot" will result in the nuclear hot insides steaming the crispy skin you spent so much time making. Better cold and crisp in my book. To be fair though, buffalo wings simply do not travel well and do not keep well. (They don't spoil, they just dry out.) So you're better off making them when you're hosting the party. Make sure you evaluate each batch of buffalo wings for "quality control."

Start off by putting the sugar into your saucepan. Ideally, the sugar should come 1/4 - 1/3 up the edge of the pan. There's quite a bit of expansion and boiling when we put the cream in at the end, so there needs to be ample room so your mixture doesn't boil over. Measure out your cream. Here's why I said around 1 cup of cream. If you have slightly more than a cup of cream, your caramel sauce will be relatively thin. I wouldn't suggest using much more than say 1 1/8 cups of cream and no less than 3/4 cups of cream. At the lower end, your sauce will be thicker, browner, and obviously, less creamy. I'm using maybe 3 T more than a cup because I have plans for this caramel sauce that require it to be somewhat thin. Stick your measured cream in the 'fridge until your sugar has cooked for a while or it'll get warm. Mix enough water in with your sugar to bring it to the consistency of mortar. When in doubt, wetter is better than drier since the water will all be boiling off anyways. #BLOCK# Technically, you don't even need water, but the added heat convection water provides will boil the sugar more evenly in the crucial beginning stages, where recrystallization is most dangerous. At this point, you should also add your choice of inhibiting agents (either the corn syrup, vinegar or cream of tartar). These help to prevent recrystallization and will give you a better chance at a smooth candy or sauce. During the caramelization of sugar, a process known as inversion breaks down the sucrose (a disaccharide) into the simpler sugars dextrose and fructose (monosaccharides). Once this inversion takes place, it is much more difficult for the sucrose to recrystallize. Adding corn syrup helps give inversion a kick-start by providing a ready source of dextrose. Adding cream of tartar or distilled vinegar add a tiny bit of acidity to the mix, which also aids the inversion process. #LABEL# +
Time to start cooking the sugar! Put the pan over high heat and start it boiling, stirring occasionally until all the sugar is dissolved in the water. Once you see steam rising and the liquid is clear, STOP STIRRING. The syrup is now super saturated with sugar. Any agitation will disrupt it and cause sugar crystals to form, which will result in cloudy candy. It's also at this point you should either brush the sides of the pan down with a pastry brush dipped in clean water or clamp a lid on the pan for a few seconds. Both will wash excess sugar off the sides of the pan. (I actually didn't do either cause I'm lazy) #BLOCK# As your sugar solution passes 300, you'll start to see changes in the color. This is the critical point in the cooking; don't walk away or go watch TV or take a nap at this point. Also, obviously, be careful. This stuff is really, really hot and it sticks to you like napalm. Also, at this point, the inversion reaction is pretty nearly complete so it's ok to start agitating the mixture a little bit. Swirl the pan gently so you get even heat distribution. Also, go get your cream. The stage where the most danger of recrystallization lies is in the soft ball stage, and may be the origin of the 17th-century expression 'sugar boiled to sugar again'. #LABEL# +

You can really see the change take place right before your eyes.

Don't be worried when your golden mass of goodness turns into a jelly-like lump at the bottom of the pot. The cold cream stopped the cooking dead, but putting it over gentle heat will dissolve the caramelized sugar into the cream and all will be smooth. This is also the point where boil over can be a problem. If the mixture starts to boil over, just remove it from the heat for a moment, stir a little bit, then put it back on. Also, don't be worried if it doesn't look brown enough yet. The Maillard reaction is responsible for the next bit of browning that will occur, and that takes place over the next few minutes. #BLOCK# The INSTANT you see wisps of smoke or smell a little bit of burning (if you're using a thermometer, this will occur at about 335-340F), take it off the heat and CAREFULLY dump your cream into it all in one motion.

Cook for 3 minutes per side or until they are golden brown in color. If at any point the oil starts to smoke or violently spit, lower the heat down. In this picture I've flipped the chicken over after the first side cooked. Tip:You can use tongs or a fork to flip the chicken over. However, have another fork or pair tongs close at hand as you will use the clean one once the chicken has been cooked. This way you use one for meat not fully cooked (dirty), and one for meat that is fully cooked (clean). This will prevent contamination. Once the chicken have become golden brown, insert the probe of an instant-read thermometer sideways into the thickest part of each breast. If the temperature reads 165º Fahrenheit or above in each, they are done.

Preheat your oven to 475º Fahrenheit. Cut off any excess fat from the chicken breasts using kitchen shears. Place a chicken breast into a bag with a zip top. Using the flat side of a meat pounder, pound the chicken breast until it is approximately 1/2" thick. Remove the flattened chicken breast to a large plate. Individually pound the remaning chicken breasts and place them on the plate. Pat down both sides of each of the chicken breasts with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. Add the egg yolk, egg whites, and water to a bowl and whisk together. Line up the plates so you can easily move the chicken from the flour mixture, to the eggs, and then to the breadcrumbs. A mnemonic to easily remember the order of breading meat is to remember "Feb" as in the abbreviated month of February to represent F (flour), E (eggs), and then B (breadcrumbs). #BLOCK# Mix the parmesan cheese and breadcrumbs together. #LABEL# -

Remove the baking sheet from the oven and quickly top each chicken breast with your desired amount of tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. It's best to leave quite a bit of the outer area of the chicken breast free of any sauce and mozzarella cheese as this will help to retain the crispiness of the Panko / parmesan crust on the chicken. No one likes soggy chicken parmesan. You can always add extra tomato sauce on the side of a plate that you can dip the chicken parmesan into. Place the chicken back into the oven and wait until the cheese has melted. If the internal temperature of the chicken didn't reach 165º Fahrenheit in the last step, be sure to verify that it now has reached that temperature before you remove it from the oven. Remove the chicken parmesan from the oven, top with shredded basil, and serve with pasta and garlic bread. Now that you have learned how to make chicken parmesan, please be sure to view these otherchicken recipes. #BLOCK# Cover a large cookie sheet with aluminum foil. Place a large wire rack on top of the aluminum foil. Spray the vegetable oil spray all over the wire rack. Transfer each of the chicken breasts from the plate to the wire rack. Make sure to space the chicken breasts evenly apart. Once all the chicken breasts have been placed onto the wire rack, it will be quite likely that some of the breadcrumbs have fallen onto the baking sheet that is covered with the aluminum foil. In order to prevent these fallen breadcrumbs from smoking while in the oven, have someone hold the wire rack with the chicken on it while you brush off any of the fallen breadcrumbs into a trash can using a paper towel. Place the wire rack back onto the baking sheet that has been covered with aluminum foil. Spray the top of each chicken breast with a quick blast of vegetable spray. This will help to give the top of the chicken breasts bit of extra crispiness as it cooks. With the chicken on the wire rack, and the wire rack on top of the baking sheet covered in aluminum foil, place it all in the oven and bake at 475º for 15-18 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer reads 165º Fahrenheit when inserted sideways into each individual chicken breast. (Note: If you know that you will be topping your chicken with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese to be placed back in the oven to melt, you can remove the chicken at about 155º-160º Fahrenheit. The chicken won't be fully cooked at that temperature. It will finish cooking while you will be wait for the cheese to melt. Doing it this way will prevent the chicken from overcooking when it goes back into the oven in the next step. Just be sure to wash your thermometer well before using it to test the temperature again in the next step).While the chicken is cooking, heat up the tomato sauce on the stove top or in the microwave. #LABEL# -

Finally, into another bowl, I cut up a bunch of celery, two heads of broccoli, and a thing of mushrooms. Set aside. #BLOCK# I cut up two skinless/boneless chicken breasts into thin strips so they would cook quicker. I cooked the chicken in a skillet with a couple turns of olive oil and a chopped clove of garlic. Once the chicken was cooked, I cut it into smaller pieces and set it aside. To the skillet, I added a 1/2 cup of chardonnay to deglaze the skillet, and let reduce until the alcohol was gone (about 5 minutes or so). This will go into the soup pot. I began the soup by putting the first bowl (onions, bell pepper, garlic) into a nice size "dutch- oven" pot with olive oil. Once the garlic and onions started to brown, I added the reduced wine from the skillet, the can of chicken stock, two cans of stewed tomatoes, one can of black-eyed beans, and the bowl with the carrots, potatoes, and cilantro, pepper, and about 4 or 5 pinches of sea salt. This I let simmer just below a boil for about 35 minutes. #LABEL# +

The reason you don't want to sever that cap is because the meat is attached to it, rather than the bone itself. Now you want to pull that part down the humerus bone, peeling it off the bone tip. The meat will stay attached to the cap (ligament?) and peel down too. Just get it off the tip for now, so it's a little loose. If any sticks to the bone, just get in there with your fingernail. It should look like this: #BLOCK# When breading and frying, you'll want to coat the chicken in something before applying the bread crumbs, to help them stick. Some use egg whites. Some use beaten eggs. I use milk to keep it a little lighter. Up to you. In a chicken wing, there are three sections. The big meaty side with the single humerus bone, the smaller portion with the radius and ulna bones, and the useless little wingtip. For the first cut, you want to go into the elbow joint, though you actually want to cut into the tip of the humerus bone. You can feel the bump where the tip of the bone is. You also don't want to cut all the way through it. A little deeper than the above is fine, just don't go all the way through. After that, hold the humerus side straight up and down, take the rest of the wing and pry it open further. There's a little cap on the tip of the bone that you don't want to sever. #LABEL# -

You can make a little cut at the top of the meat, where the bone is sticking out, which will help it turn inside out. Just yank it, it takes some effort before you get the gist of what you're doing.

Now you want to take out the extra bone, which will be the smaller one. Push the meat down (not inside out, yet). Hold the wing by the larger bone and gently rotate the smaller one down so that it's inline, kind of like winding a clock hand from noon to 6 o'clock.

From here, you can do any number of things with them. Slather them in a sauce and grill them for a BBQ, fry them as I'll show below, any way you cook bone- in chicken. As for why the fuss of doing this complicated cutting process, the end result looks really crazy, and since the meat is sort of piled at the bottom, rather than pulled taut over a bone from joint to joint, it's incredibly tender. For the frying, set up your ingredients. I use an equal mix of plain bread crumbs and grated parmesan cheese. #BLOCK# Pull the meat inside-out on it the same way as before.

Set up a small pot with a few inches of oil to medium-high heat. You can use a fryer or deep fry thermometer if you want, but I eyeball everything and this works. Hold your chicken by the bone (they make very useful handles for cooking and eating) and dunk it in milk (or whatever you're using) then dunk it in the bread mix, coating it well. Then put it in the oil. Repeat with enough so that you're not crowding the pot too much. This part is a little gross, but sometimes a bit of blood from inside the bone will squirt out of the tip sticking out. Just make sure to get that bone tip into the oil for a second or two to seal it up. Once they get nice and brown, take them out. #BLOCK# From here, you can do any number of things with them.

You can eat them with a selection of dipping sauces or just as is, either way they are great. I also like to slather them in a good buffalo wing sauce, since I have an obsession with making really fancied up versions of normal food like buffalo wings or grilled cheese sandwiches.

They are a bit labor intensive for what you get out of it, but they do make for some very impressive hors d'oeuvres/grill nibbles for $10. It's definitely a part of my 'impress new girlfriend' menu.

Anyway, I didn't take pictures of the individual steps since my hands were covered in flour and wine. First, sift together the flour, cinnamon, sugar, and cocoa. I nuked the butter for a little while to soften it and then mixed it in with my hands. Next comes the wine. Again, if you've made pasta dough, add it like you would water. If you haven't, just add a very little bit at a time (about a tbsp at a time or less). Mix each addition thoroughly with your hands before adding more. What your looking for is a dough that's a little stiff, stays together, but isn't sticky. If your dough breaks apart, add a little more wine and work it together. If it's sticky, add a pinch of flour and combine. When I say add a little, I mean it. A little goes a long way. Here's what I ended up with. Sorry for the crappy picture, but trust me when I say that it works out great. I let it chill in the fridge for about an hour because all the recipes said to. I admit I have no idea why. #BLOCK# The ingredients:2 c flour 1/4 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp sugar 1 tbsp unsweetened cocoa 2 tbsp butter some Marsala wine 1 egg white, slightly whipped (not pictured) OK, if you've ever made pasta dough, it's almost identical. The only real difference is the butter and instead of a water or egg base, it's a wine base. Myself, I like the good stuff. I went to my local liquor store and looked for the most expensive bottle of Marsala wine I could fine. I'm no Mr. Moneybags, but I don't skimp on quality, so I shelled out the necessary $13. The egg is for sealing the dough around the mold, so we won't use it for a little while yet. #LABEL# -
Once it's chilled, we get to the no-fun part - rolling it out and cutting. Now, all the recipes I found online will tell you to get a rolling pin and flatten it to 1/8" to 1/16" thick. I did that the first time, too. But then I remembered my comparisons to pasta dough and whipped out this: My handy-dandy hand cranked pasta maker. It's cheap, made of solid steel, and works like a charm. If you have one, I highly recommend that you use it. If you don't have one, get one and use it. They're actually pretty inexpensive. Anyway, they way I do it is to take a quarter of the dough at a time. I flatten it with my hand to get it as thin as possible and feed it through at the "1" setting. I fold it over and run it through again. Repeat for 3 or 4 times to get it nice and smooth. Than run it through the "2" setting, then the "3", etc. all the way up to "5" or "6". The first batch this time I ended at 6, but thought it was bit thin. #BLOCK# Anyway, I didn't take pictures of the individual steps since my hands were covered in flour and wine.

Now you want to cut it out into 4" to 5" circles. I don't have a cookie cutter, but the lid from my sugar container (in the top of the picture) is the perfect size, so I use that. After they're cut, you want to make them slightly oval shaped. You can either run them over with the rolling pin or run them through the pasta maker at the same setting. Here are mine: The two that aren't too oval I actually ran through again to make more oval, but forgot to take pictures. Also, if you want you can reflatten the leftover dough and probably get 6 or so shells from one quarter of the dough we made. Yeah, that's a lot of shells. #BLOCK# Anyway, a quarter of the dough ends up like this: #LABEL# -
Next, wrap the cutout around the mold and seal it by brushing the end with a little bit of the egg white. Here they are, ready for the deep fryer. #BLOCK# Set your deep fryer to somewhere between 360 to 375 (Fahrenheit). Or, if you're like me, heat the oil to that temp. You're going to want to cook them until they're brown and bubbly, which will take 2 to 3 minutes. This was my first time deep frying anything, so one thing I learned about deep frying on a stove is that once you put the stuff in, the temperature will drop a lot. Anyway, they'll look like this in the pot when they're done: #LABEL# +
Take them out and let them cool on some paper towels. They only need a few minutes to cool while handling. While they're cooking, I actually prepare the next batch of shells. Then I can, I just slide off the shell and put the new ones one there. The shells should just slide off. They may need a bit of work. They're pretty strong, so don't worry too much about manhandling them. The big bubbles may burst, but it's just air anyway, so it doesn't matter. #BLOCK# I made 16 shells. I could probably have made more, but the amount of filling I could make wouldn't fill any more.

In my opinion, a good cannoli shell should be a little flaky, crispy, and not that crunchy. #BLOCK# Cannoli Filling:Cannoli filling at its most basic is ricotta cheese and powdered sugar. Other stuff can be added to great effect (which I will be doing). Here is all you need for a great cannoli filling: 1 lb ricotta cheese powdered sugar to taste You can probably cheap out on nearly every ingredient except for the ricotta. It is what the cannoli is all about and if you skimp, your cannoli will suffer. Me, I buy it at a cheese shop that makes it daily. If you happen to live in the Lehigh Valley in PA, you can head to Calandra's Italian Cheeses just off of 33 for some fresh ricotta (and mozzarella, too). The powdered sugar is to taste. Personally, I like about 1 cup with 1 lb of ricotta. It preserves the great cheesiness, and makes it just sweet enough. Just add it about 1/4 cup at a time until you like the taste. I forgot to take a picture of the finished filling, but you just mix until nice and creamy. From here, you can just pipe it into a shell (I use a Ziploc bag with a corner cut off) and have one of the best cannoli you'll ever eat. If the filling is too thick, you can mix in about a tablespoon or so of lemon juice to thin it out. Be careful, though. The filling should last a while in a Ziploc bag in your fridge. The cannoli shells by themselves will last for a long time. Once you pipe the filling into the cannoli, you have about a day before the cannoli become very soggy. It'll still taste good, but the shell will lose its crispiness and flakiness. It just won't be as awesome. But who's satisfied with just awesome? I say we move past awesome to wicked awesome (I'm from New England, so give me a break). #LABEL# +

Chocolate + hazelnut + cannoli = amazing taste. Here are the ingredients: hazelnut liqueur (I was shocked my liquor store had this stuff) 10 to 12 oz semisweet or bittersweet baking chocolate 1/2 c heavy cream The hazelnut liqueur goes into the filling, the chocolate goes onto the shells. I actually divided my filling into two portions so I could make this and the next filling. For me, I like my flavorings very subtle. Enough so you know it's there, but not enough to overpower the cheesy goodness. In my half-batch, a little more than 1 tbsp of liqueur was enough. 2 whole tablespoons should be enough for a whole batch. That's the easy part The chocolate isn't as easy. For a coating this time, I tried a heavy ganache. I'll see how it turns out. Basically, a ganache is boiling cream added to chocolate. Start off by boiling the half a cup of cream.

Pour a hefty amount of the superfine sugar into one of the buttered ramekins. Holding it over another buttered ramekin, turn the ramekin every which way until a light layer of the sugar sticks to the bottom and sides. It's ok if some of the sugar spills out into the other ramekin. Once it looks like the image on the left, pour the excess sugar into the other ramekin. You can even give the ramekin some light taps to make sure the excess sugar comes out. Repeat until all of the ramekins are coated in sugar. What the sugar does is act as little wheels to help the soufflé rise. Place the ramekins into the refrigerator. #BLOCK# Preheat your oven to 350º Fahrenheit. For this recipe you will need 6 six-ounce ramekins. Using a pastry brush or your finger, brush the melted butter on the bottom and sides of the ramekins until thinly coated. Soufflé Making Tip: Use upward brush strokes on the sides of the ramekins. This will create groves in the butter to help the soufflé rise straight up. Place the ramekins into the refrigerator for a couple of minutes to allow the butter to harden. Remove the ramekins from the refrigerator, dip your brush into the melted butter butter, and go over the sides of the ramekins again using upward strokes. As soon as the butter touches the cold ramekin it will stick to it. The reason for brushing the sides twice is insure that the chocolate soufflé doesn't stick to the side of ramekin. If it does, it won't rise. #LABEL# -
For this step we are using vanilla to flavor the chocolate soufflé. However, you could easily change up the flavors by adding anything else. For instance, maybe the peel of an orange. Add the milk to a saucepan. Slice open the vanilla bean lengthwise. #BLOCK# Pour a hefty amount of the superfine sugar into one of the buttered ramekins.

Extremely important:You can not get ANY, not even a drop, of broken egg yolk mixed with your egg whites. Otherwise, when you make the meringue later on, the fat in the egg yolk will prevent the egg whites from whipping up. Also, try not to touch the egg whites with your fingers, as your skin naturally has oil in it. Tip:Use cold eggs if you want the whites to separate easier from the yolks. Best Way to Separate EggsGet out 2 small bowls and one medium-sized bowl. One small bowl will be just for safety (preventing cracked yolk from mixing with the whites), the medium-sized bowl will be for only the yolks, and the final small bowl will be for only the whites. Crack an egg on a small bowl. Cup your other hand, and allow the egg white to flow through the cracks between your fingers. Fling your hand a bit if you need to until you are left with just the yoke. Place the yolk in the medium-sized bowl. Now, whichever bowl is empty will be your safety bowl in case a yolk breaks. Crack the next egg over the safety bowl. This way if you accidentally break open a yolk, it falls into the safety bowl and doesn't ruin the bowl holding your egg whites. Should you split a yolk in the safety bowl, throw out or cook up that egg and wash out the safety bowl, and try again with a new egg. Again, place the yolk in the bowl with the yolks, and dump the egg white in the safety bowl into the bowl with the egg whites. Once you have 3 egg yolks in the medium- sized bowl, do whatever you want with the other 3 egg yolks — cook them up, stick them in the fridge to make pasta with later, etc. Add 3 tablespoons of superfine sugar to the medium-sized bowl containing the 3 egg yolks. #LABEL# +

Here is the chocolate soufflé base. Now we just need to whip up the egg whites to create a meringue to add to the chocolate soufflé base. #BLOCK# You may have wondered how a soufflé rises. When you beat egg whites their proteins unfold (denature) and stretch. This creates an elastic skin that traps air bubbles. When the meringue is mixed with the soufflé batter and heated, this trapped air expands, causing the soufflé to rise. How to Make a MeringueImportant Meringue Making Tips:Thoroughly wash and dry the beaters for your electric hand mixer. If there is any amount of fat from the egg yolks on the beaters, the elastic skin won't be able to form and thus air can't be trapped. Also, it's best not to make a soufflé on a humid or rainy day as it's harder for the eggs to whip up. Add the 6 egg whites into a large glass, stainless-steel, or copper bowl. By this point the eggs should be about room temperature. Feel the bottom of the bowl the bowl to test the temperature, don't use your finger. If not, leave them out a bit longer. Attach the beaters to your hand mixer. If you don't have an electric hand mixer you can use a regular whisk. #LABEL# +
Beat the egg whites on high until they become frothy. If you have any cream of tartar in your spice cabinet add a small pinch — like 1/16 of a tsp. This acid will help denature the proteins quicker, helping the meringue to form quicker. This should take about 1 minute. With the mixer still going, gradually add in the final 3 tablespoons of superfine sugar. You want to beat the egg whites and sugar for a bit after each tablespoon has been added. Once all the sugar has been added, keep the mixer going for another 6 to 7 minutes or until stiff peaks form. To test for stiff peaks, turn off the mixer, and hold up the beaters so they are upside down. If the egg whites hold a stiff peak (peak doesn't flop over) then they are ready. See photo on the left for how the meringue holds a stiff peak. Tip:As your are beating the egg whites, look for the point right when the whites start to lose their shine.

You don't want to scrape off any of the sugar, otherwise the chocolate soufflés won't rise. Now, you can either fill them up a little over 3/4 of the way full like I did or you can fill them up completely. If you fill them 3/4 of the way, rub your finger all around the top lip of the ramekin to remove the sugar. If you don't do this the outside top edges of the chocolate soufflé will have sugar crystals stuck to them. If you want to fill them up completely for the largest rise, just level off the soufflé batter using the flat side of a knife. This way you a level top. If you are wondering if you can refrigerate the chocolate soufflés at this stage, I wouldn't suggest it. If anything, refrigerate the soufflé base if you need to but always make the meringue fresh right before baking. Bake the soufflés for 15-18 minutes. The tops will be a tad darker and the soufflé should be rise about 1-2 inches. Carefully remove the chocolate soufflés from the oven. You will need either tongs with a rubber grip or oven mitts as they will be very hot. Before serving, dust with powdered sugar. You can then top your chocolate soufflés with fresh whipped cream or a single raspberry. You only have about 5 minutes before the air inside the soufflé deflates, so serve them immediately if you want the best presentation. Should the soufflés deflate before you are able to present them, you could always run a knife around the sides of the ramekin so they fall out when held upside down over a plate. Then just heat the soufflés up a bit in the microwave. The air should expand a bit again, although not as much as before.

Throw a little bit more flour on top, and let the dough sit there for a few minutes. While that's sitting there, you can do the optional pan addition I mentioned. It's really a trick I picked up from sticky rolls. Basically, you mix melted butter and brown sugar together, then pour that in the bottom of your pan before you put the rolls in. While the rolls are baking, the sugar caramelizes. Delicious caramel. I did it this time, because I'm on a caramel kick, but again, totally optional. And ps, you're using a 9" x 13" x 2" pan. #LABEL# -
Roll the dough out with a floured rolling pin (or wine bottle, whatever) until it's a big rectangle. The official measurements are 16" x 21", but I hate rulers, so I just eyeball it. #BLOCK# After you've got that nice and rolled out, you want to put the filling in. Take your butter for the filling, and melt it. Once it's melted, use a pastry brush and brush it over the entire surface of the dough. Then, take your cinnamon and brown sugar, mix them and break up the brown sugar clumps, and sprinkle that evenly over the dough. Leave about 1/2" of one of the long sides filling-free, because that will be the end of your roll, and then it will stick better to the other dough. My dough here has some extra brown sugar sprinkled on it, simply because I thought it needed more. Also, with respect to cinnamon, if you can get it, get the Vietnamese cinnamon. Much more potent than your average grocery store cinnamon. #LABEL# +
You'll end up with a log of dough. It's okay if the ends aren't exactly even - you can press them in a bit to even them out. Then you need to cut the log into 12 rolls. I use thread, because a knife squishes your dough, and we don't want that. To use a thread (or unwaxed, unflavored floss, whatever), just cut off about a 10" length of thread. Then slide the thread underneath your dough to where you want to make the cut. Bring the ends up and pull them towards each other, like you're about to tie a bow with them. Then just keep pulling until you've cut through the dough. Cutting in progress: Cut the log in half, then each half in half, and then those into thirds, and you'll have evenly- sized rolls. #BLOCK# Then it's time to roll. Start at a long edge, and roll up, like so: #LABEL# -
Then place your now cut rolls into your pan, as evenly as you can. It's okay that they're not touching, they'll get bigger. Let those rise in a warm place for about half an hour, or until doubled in size. While those are rising, take out the cream cheese and butter for the icing so that they soften up. After 30 minutes of rising bake them at 400 F for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. #BLOCK# You'll end up with a log of dough.

While the rolls are baking, make your icing. I usually use a mixer only briefly for the icing, to get the cream cheese and butter nice and smooth. So, start by beating your cream cheese and butter together until smooth. Then add the salt and vanilla, then start adding the confectioner's sugar gradually, creaming the sugar and butter/cheese mixture together, like so: #BLOCK# Then place your now cut rolls into your pan, as evenly as you can.

Mocha Bread Pudding: I intentionally made this so it’s not very sweet, but it is rich and has a very unique mocha flavor. I was really happy with the way it turned out. You’ll need something else to go with this, either ice cream, whipped cream, caramel sauce, etc. I used Lindt bittersweet chocolate, but it had been a while since I had Lindt and I wasn’t terribly happy with it, which was disappointing. I would recommend Valrhona, Scharffenberger, Ghirardelli, or my absolute favorite, Chocovic Ocumare Single Origin Dark Chocolate from Venezuala (often found at Trader Joe’s).

The end result. Pour yourself a bowl and garnish with the peanuts you chopped up - just a few for crunchy crunchy goodness. This soup can be served hot or cold - it's a TAD less heavy when hot. When it's chilled it's almost a desert soup. This isn't a whole meal all by itself though - more of a small bowl served before a heavy meal like meat. The end result is VERY tasty and is not like eating peanut butter at all. It's heavy and definitly peanut based, but surprisingly tasty. One thing to resist, for authenticity sake is spices. While Williamsburg would have had spices to work with, they wouldn't have had anything like the variety that we have now. If you add hot pepper you will find yourself in Thai cooking land. Not authentic but tasty none the less. If you add salt and pepper, you lose some of the interesting tastes that just cooking with vegies and peanuts gets you. All in all a FINE recipe, pretty cheap and pretty fast, that I would suggest as a contribution to, say, a thanksgiving meal that you're invited too. Nobody else will bring it and everyone will be surprised by that taste! If I'd been on Hells' Kitchen, I would have served this as my initial dish to impress chef Gordon Ramsay.

Reheat before serving (I actually think it's good cold too, but most disagree with me), garnish each serving with the chives. There you have it, delicious gourmet creamy carrot soup in less than an hour. The book says this makes 6 servings, but my family of four often eats the entire thing in a meal. For 6, this soup is 110 calories and 2.1 grams of fat, so for four that's about 150 calories and 3 grams of fat (me estimating). It's incredibly filling despite being pretty healthy.

Now you have a choice to make based on how long you want to wait until your chili is done. The first option is to use a dutch oven if you are willing to heat up your oven and wait 2-2.5 hours. The other option would be to use a pressure cooker. When you use a pressure cooker you drastically reduce the time it takes to break down the meat and infuse flavors. You can have chili ready to eat in as little as 30 minutes. I went with the pressure cooking method. Either in your dutch oven or in a 6 quart pressure cooker pot over medium-high heat, brown the beef and pork (not the chorizo) in 3 separate batches so as to not overcrowd the pan which would steam the meat instead of browning it. Place the browned meat onto a plate while you brown the next batch. #BLOCK# Once all the meat has been browned and removed to a plate, you should see that the bottom of the pan has nice crusty brown bits on it. This is called fond and contains quite a bit of flavor. #LABEL# +

If you don't want a really hearty chili, add some chicken or beef broth (about 8 ounces) if you have some on hand. #BLOCK# Once all the meat has been browned and removed to a plate, you should see that the bottom of the pan has nice crusty brown bits on it.

Now, let's make our pears, starting about 30 minutes before you want to serve your flan, as they should be warm, it's a nice contrast with the cold flan. Here's what you'll need; 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 3 ripe pears, unpeeled, quartered, cored 1/4 cup pure maple syrup 1/4 cup sour cream 1/8 teaspoon salt If you don't have an ovenproof skillet, then use one skillet to cook the pears on the stove-top, and then make sure that you get everything from the skillet into your pan you intent to use in the oven. Melt your butter in the skillet over medium-high heat, and throw in your pears, one of the cut sides down. Cook for about 4 minutes, until they're nice and brown on the side in the butter. Turn to the other cut side, and cook for about another 4 minutes. Pour in the maple syrup and bring to a boil. If your skillet is oven-proof, stick it in the oven at 375. If not, use a spatula and get everything from the skillet into the pan, and make sure the pears are skin-up. Cook for about 25 minutes, until the pears are soft and brown. #BLOCK# Use a slotted spoon to get the pears out, and mix your sour cream and salt in sauce left in the pan, until it's nice and creamy. Throw your pears back in, tossing them around so they're coated in sauce. #LABEL# +
Take a sharp, thin knife and go around the edges of your flan, and then invert it onto a platter. Slice it into thin slices, serve it with a few pears, and drizzle the sour cream sauce over the whole thing. Trust me, it is heaven in your mouth. Mine shoud have cooked a bit longer, so that's why it looks like it's about to fall over, it's not as firm.

You can make this recipe for around $3 USD and it serves 4 people. The unlabeled can in the above picture is sweet and condensed milk. Also, only the yolks of the eggs will be used for this recipe. I use 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla, and I caramelize 1/2 cup of sugar. You can use any bake ware capable of taking 350 degree heat, if its a smooth bottom the caramelized sugar spreads easier. I use a bunt pan cause it is pretty snazzy looking. Also worth noting: I am using silicone based dishes, which have low specific heat, and disperse heat very quickly - this is sort of nice, for cooling off flan, and also cooling off caramelized sugar. Notice the baking dish that you use must fit inside of the other container, with room to fit water up to the level the flan will be. #BLOCK# You have to separate the egg yolks.

After you have mixed the main stuff together, it is time to the caramelize the sugar. Once again, I use 1/2 cup of sugar, but sometimes if I use a smoother dish, I'll use 1/3ish. No big deal really either way. Start with a sauce pan. Put sugar in sauce pan over low heat. LOW HEAT, especially for beginners, cause its really easy to burn sugar if you are not careful. At first, just swirl the pan around to keep sugar moving. If you use a spoon, the sugar will start to clump up right away and its a bit more difficult. #BLOCK# Add Sweet and condensed milk, evaporated milk, and 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla.

Now, after you have beaten the ingredients for the flan together, you might very well end up with foam on top. This wont hurt anything, however, as you might imagine, the foam offers up more surface area, and so if you have foam on the top of your flan, you tend to end up with a burn layer/crust on the bottom of your flan (you flip the container over to serve). If you want to skip the next step, feel free! But, I don't like to have that crust in my flan, so... #BLOCK# Careful! Different temperature variations can break glass.

How to make fortune cookiesFirst, let's make the fortunes for our fortune cookies. You will need a ruler and some scissors. The fortunes need to be about 3 inches long and 1/2 inch wide. You will then need to decide if you want to write out the fortunes by hand or if you want to print them using a printer. If you do it by hand, grab a ruler, mark off off the 3 inch width and draw a line straight down the page. Then cut the paper along that line. You now have a 3 inch wide piece of paper. Make small marks down the page every 1/2 inch. Then cut along those lines. You now have a handfull of strips to write on. Be sure to write your fortunes out using a non-toxic ink pen. If you are going to print them off, just open up a word document and use the built-in ruler feature to make sure you keep the text within the 3 inches long by 1/2 inch wide dimensions. Then print out the page of fortunes and cut the strips out. #BLOCK# Get out 2 medium-sized mixing bowls and a small bowl.&gt;  Over the small bowl, gently crack open an egg right down the center, and carefully separate the egg whites from the yolks. To do this you just pour the yolk back and forth between each half of the egg shell, letting all the whites fall into the small bowl. Repeat this step with the other egg so you have the whites of two eggs in the small bowl. Discard the yolks or save them for a different recipe.&gt; Pour the egg whites into one of the medium-sized bowls and give them a quick 10 second whisk. Add the vanilla extract and vegetable oil and continue whisking until the mixture gets a bit foamy.  google_ad_section_end  2 #LABEL# +
While mixing with the electric mixer, very slowly pour in the egg mixture into the thick paste. Once everything is fully incorporated, you should have a smooth and runny fortune cookie batter. #BLOCK# In the empty medium-sized bowl, add the sugar, cornstarch, salt, flour, and water. Use an electric hand mixer to fully combines the ingredients until a thick paste forms.&gt; At this point, go ahead and start pre-heating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  google_ad_section_end  3 #LABEL# -
While mixing with the electric mixer, very slowly pour in the egg mixture into the thick paste. Once everything is fully incorporated, you should have a smooth and runny fortune cookie batter. #BLOCK# Grease a baking sheet or two with a thin layer of butter. Using a tablespoon measure, fill up the measure with the fortune cookie batter and then slowly pour it onto the baking sheet in a circular manner. Repeat this until until you have filled up your baking sheet. Be sure to leave about 2 inches between each circle of batter. Take your pan and then make quick, minute tilts — up, down, and side-to-side, so as to use gravity to thin out the circles even more. See the image to the left.&gt; Place the sheet into the oven. For me, after about 11 minutes or so, I noticed that they were quickly turning golden brown. Your time may differ, so keep an eye on them. Once you start to see about 12 inch of the outer circle turning golden, go ahead, slip your cotton gloves on, and use a spatula to take out a cookie.

Place the fortune cookie on its side in a muffin baking pan as shown in the picture. The circular shape of where a muffin would normally go will help keep the fortune cookies shape as they cool and harden. If you find that the cookie isn't keeping the shape after you place it in, have a partner gently put pressure on them to keep their shape as they harden. Having a partner greatly helps speed up the process, and lets you focus on getting the other cookies folded as quickly as possible before they burn in the oven or harden up before you have had a chance to fold them.&gt; Repeat these steps for each fortune cookie. It should only take at most 5-10 seconds to place a fortune and fold each cookie. If you need to make multiple batches, be sure to use a cold baking pan each time. That's why it's good to have 2 pans on hand so while one is cooling, you can use the other.  &gt; **Some ideas:** Dip your fortune cookies into melted chocolate and top with nuts or sprinkles. If you are a chocolate lover, you could even try adding cocoa powder to your fortune cookie batter. You could also add food coloring to your fortune cookie batter to make them perfect for any holiday. Maybe orange or green for Halloween or red for Christmas. Or maybe try adding various ingredients to your batter such as ginger, cinnamon, etc. Let us know what you come up with and how it was!Now that you have learned how to make fortune cookies, please be sure to view these othercookies recipes. #BLOCK# Then bend the other side (flat side) over the edge of a coffee mug until the ends almost touch.

As soon as the salt pork begins to sizzle, toss in the onion and celery, along with a pinch or two of salt. Leave that on the burner over medium heat, stirring occasionally. We're sauteing to a nice medium brown, which we'll come back to in a while. #BLOCK# Celeriac is, for those unaware, the root of the celery plant. It is available fairly widely in the U. S., though nowhere near as high in quality as in Europe. Individual roots vary in size from billiard ball to bowling ball. It's rare to find one larger than 4-5" across in the States. In flavor, celeriac strongly resembles celery, but cooking brings out strong notes of parsnip. It's one of my favorite root vegetables to use as the base of a sauce, because it adds the usual celery savor plus a little something extra. Start Preparing: Prep the celeriac. Start by removing the top. Retain the greenery for later stock making if you want; I find celery still attached to the sellable roots to be fairly tough and unappealing raw. Now turn it over and cut thin slices off the root until you get most of the furrows and uneven spots clean. Trim off any remaining bits of the outside, then slice across the root in ~1.5 cm thick pieces. It's a root veggie with lots of character. The inner structure has lots of visual texture to it, but it's pretty smooth when eating. If you plan to leave celeriac out for long give it a squirt of lemon juice, as it will oxidize and turn more brown. Trim the celeriac slices into nice squarish shapes for easy handling during the frying process. Chop up the rest of the root roughly and set it aside for a moment. Also chop up the half onion. Start up a burner with a medium saucepan. Put in a bit of olive oil and the salt pork. #LABEL# -

You will need THREE bowls (cereal sized). You will also need enough oil to fill your fryer, or 1-2 inches worth in a high-walled skillet or dutch oven pot. If you don't want to fry it, there are other ways to cook them, so fret not. I'll go over a few ways later. First, mince the water chestnuts. They should be very fine. You will need about 3/8 cups if you're the measuring type, but I tend to eyeball it now. The correct amount usually winds up being about half a small can. Put the minced water chestnut in one of your bowls. Let's call it bowl #1 Next you will need about 3 table spoons of minced scallion (green onion). Again, I rarely measure it, but it winds up being 2-3 stalks of plant. Make sure you wash it first! Put this in a different bowl from the water chestnut, bowl #2. #BLOCK# Ginger. Be careful with this stuff; it's super potent. You buy it by the "hand". It should have nice even color with no spots. Dirt is ok (it also means it's probably fresh). #LABEL# +
Ginger. Be careful with this stuff; it's super potent. You buy it by the "hand". It should have nice even color with no spots. Dirt is ok (it also means it's probably fresh). #BLOCK# I couldn't get pics of myself doing this, but the best way to peel this stuff is to hold it in the palm of your hand and scrape over it with a spoon, concave face towards you. If you do it correctly, the spoon will scrape off the skin and leave the flesh of the ginger root clean and unharmed. Make sure you smell the ginger. GOOD ginger will smell fresh and clean. It sounds corny, but it smells kind of like springtime. You will need 1.5 Tbsp. of this, fully minced. Put it in the bowl with the green onions. #LABEL# +

Shrimp - This is very important. Always buy fresh, and always ask to smell it before you buy it. You should do this with any seafood, unless you're confident it's from a reputable reseller. It should smell clean, and not like fish. That Emeril guy says it should smell like the sea. I would partially agree, but I think the best way to explain it is it just smells fresh. #BLOCK# Combine the ginger with the minced scallion (green onion) in bowl #2. #LABEL# -

From here on out you will be moving fairly fast. All of your pieces are very small, and they will cook very fast. You MUST pay attention or your stuffing will be ruined. On a medium flame, heat up a non-stick skillet. Once it's hot, pour some canola oil in the pan. You'll need about 1 Tbsp. worth, but this is one of those things you feel after you get the hang of it. I forgot to take a picture of this next part, but luckily you need only to rely on your nose. You will dump the onions and ginger (bowl #2) into the skillet, and keep it moving over a medium heat until you can smell the fragrance of the scallion and ginger mixing. The scallions will begin to wilt, but other than that you need to trust your sense of smell. This next part is very important. We will be par-cooking the shrimp. This means we're going to Partially cook the shrimp. It will be done on the outside, and slightly unfinished on the inside. This is so that it will finish cooking when you cook the wonton.

When all of the shrimp has JUST turned pink, quickly dump in the sauce mixture, mix it in very well, and take the skillet off the heat. Then mix enough water into your corn starch - which you intelligently set aside so you'd be ready - to completely liquefy it. Pour this into your skillet and mix it in fast. If you take too long to stir it in it will get clumpy and gooey. This is when you need to pour in the sauce: #BLOCK# And this is after it's all done: Put it in a bowl like I did. That's it for a while. Relax - let the mixture cool enough to handle because the next part is very hands-on. If you have a fryer, set it to 375 degrees F (190 C) and allow it to pre-heat. If you want to deep fry this in a pot, heat your oil in a heavy-bottomed dutch oven. You will need a candy/oil thermometer, and you will need to make sure it doesn't get too hot or too cold. This method is pretty dangerous if you don't know what you're doing, and I don't suggest it if you've never done it before. Plenty of people have burned their houses down with frying mistakes. See the bottom of this page for frying alternatives. If you want to deep fry them though, buy a proper fryer. Keeping an eye on your oil temperature is a pain. #LABEL# +

Also, be sure to not stack them up, since they stick to each other once they're wet. #BLOCK# I fry 5-6 at a time. They expand, so I would suggest not doing more than that unless your vessel can hold them. When you fry them, they should give out lots of bubbles. This is from the water in the wontons vaporizing and bubbling out. This forms a wall of water vapor that keeps the fat from penetrating the food. When the bubbling stops, you run the risk of getting tons of grease in your food. This is one of the reasons you need to make sure everything stays tight, sealed, and clean. When they're lightly browned all over, take them out and drain them. The best way to do that is to put them on paper shopping bags to wick away the grease. This recipe makes about 25 wontons, so you'll have plenty to eat as a meal, or freeze them and eat them later. Now, for those who don't want to deep fry:You can steam these by supporting perforated tin in a covered pot with 1-2" of simmering water. I never steam mine, so I couldn't tell you when they would be officially done. Usually they use rice paper for steaming things. You can make pot stickers, though, by lightly coating the pan with canola oil and allowing them to cook over a hot flame until they're slightly sticking to the bottom of the pan. Obviously, if you have a non-stick pan, they won't stick very well. Once they stick, you will need to quickly dump in a cup or so of chicken stock and cover the pan immediately. The stock will steam the wonton, and help unstick it from the bottom of the pan. Once the stock evaporates, you can let them sit for a little while to crisp up again. Last but not least, you can pan fry them by coating a hot pan in oil and allowing the wontons to cook on all sides until evenly browned. It's simple, and gives a pretty close approximation to deep frying.

Now take your med-large pan. My pans are teflon-coated, with handles that are ok in the oven up to 375 degrees. This isn't quite what the recipe would like you to have, but I made it work. Just, please, don't melt your cookware in the oven, make sure if you use your pans that the handles can handle the heat you're using. If in doubt, a baking pan will do the trick. Put 2 tbsp. of butter in the pan (you can pre-melt the whole batch of butter if you want, or melt it 2 tbsp. at a time in the pans. I pre-melted it in the microwave) and, once melted, swirl it around the pan to coat it. Add approximately 1/2 a cup of the batter to the pan, and swirl that around as well. This should leave you with a relatively thin layer (1/4" or so) of batter in the bottom of the pan. #BLOCK# If you haven't guessed already with the butter, heavy cream, and 10 eggs, this is a rich recipe, and eating it on a regular basis will make you un-healthy in no time. I have it probably 4 times a year or so. The recipe as is says it serves 6 people. I tried to serve 7 college kids with it (including myself) with a pound of bacon to accompany it, and it wasn't quite enough. Kitchen utensils required: Big bowl, measuring stuff, mixer or whisk, several medium- large pans that are ok to put INSIDE the oven (cast-iron would be best, but many pot/pan sets have handles that are heat-resistant to a point). A baking dish of a decent size should work ok too. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees. If you're using cookware that can't take that kind of heat, get it as hot as your pans can take...just adjust the cooking time accordingly. Get yourself a big bowl, and combine the water, heavy cream, and powdered milk. Beat this mixture until its smooth, then add the eggs (I'd recommend cracking them all into another container first, as picking the shells out of the white mixture you now have isn't very easy), the powdered sugar, flour (recipe says sifted for accuracy of measurement...I read somewhere that whisking the flour will have the same effect, and that's what I did), salt, baking powder, and nutmeg. Beat all of this until it is smooth. I'd recommend a mixer for best results, but I got by all right with a whisk. It should look something like this: #LABEL# -

I had two different sized pans to use (8" and 10" I think) so I used them both. I just staggered their location in the oven so that one wasn't blocking the heat to the other from below. As my pans can only take 375 degrees in the oven, it took them a little longer than the 12 minutes expected at 400 degrees. Also, the larger pan obviously took a little longer to cook the larger pancake than the little guy. Just keep checking on them. This is the bad part though. You've probably already thought of it, but if you haven't, here it is: even if you have more pans than this, your oven probably can't accomodate them. So you can only cook 2 of these pancakes at a time. This makes breakfast sort of a drawn-out process, with the cook eating last, unless you keep them warm somewhere else while you keep pumping them out. I opted to go with the first option, watching my roommates enjoy the fruits of my labors while I slaved away. #LABEL# +

I prefer lemon and powdered sugar, though I have noticed there are recipes for all sorts of fruity syrups and toppings floating around the Internet. If you like lemon at all though, I suggest trying this topping, it's really easy too. Just halve all of your lemons, and juice them. If you don't have a juicer, squeeze them yourself. Alternatively, you could buy the juice. But I like it better freshly squeezed. #LABEL# +

Make sure the middle isn't still soggy though, that sucks. GRAB A HOT MITT and pull these guys out. Make sure you remember to keep that hot mitt handy, because seeing a pan on the stovetop, you don't always think to have a hot mitt on. I grabbed the 375 degree handles on my pans with no hot mitt at least 4 times making these things. If you have something standing by to keep them warm, shove them in there (a toaster oven may do the trick) or if you're serving them up immediately, slap them on a plate. Add some lemon juice, I like a lot. #LABEL# +

Please note that to be truly authentic and have the best possible results, only LARD should be used in the frying steps of this recipe. I decided my cholesterol was already bad enough thanks to the slabs of bacon from the second course, so I elected to put a Spanish spin on the preparation and use olive oil instead. As with most great recipes, this one begins with deep frying everything. Take special care, however: dried chiles take just a few seconds of frying to reach doneness. Fry them for too long and they burn, rendering (heh lard joke) the whole dish overwhelmingly bitter and unpleasant. Be VERY attentive when doing this. Start by heating up a fryer full of your oil of choice. Cut the top off each chile, open them up, and remove all of the seeds. If necessary, excise the ribs of the chile as well - this will also make the finished product less spicy. #BLOCK# Pico de Gallo garnish:- 1 pasilla chile, fresh - 1 anaheim chile, fresh - 3-4 jalapeno chilies, fresh - 2-4 serrano chilies, fresh - 2-3 tomatoes - 1/2 large onion - juice of 3-5 key limes (or 1-2 regular limes) - salt to taste #LABEL# -

Mix the flour and water together. Keep playing with it until you form a ball. I use a "packing" method myself - just start with the sticky dough in the middle and pack the flour onto it, then fold it over itself, squish down, and fold it again, then pack on some more flour and repeat (easier to do, than it is to read). When it is holding together, yet flaky, start pressing into a ball. Next kneed the dough for about 10 minutes. Lightly flour your counter - you only need about a pinch. Take the dough ball and slam it into your counter, punch it a few times and try to flatten it out a little. Using the bottom part of the palm of your hands, start pressing the dough away from you. Be rough with it, you want to stretch it and give it a good work out. Fold the dough in back towards you and turn 90 degrees. Repeat this procedure for the ten minutes. After a few minutes you should start to notice that the dough is getting a bit more elastic and easier to press out. The dough is ready when you are able to push lightly on it with your finger and it'll bounce back into shape, has no more stickyness to it, and is soft and smooth. Finally, cover the dough with a damp towel for 10 minutes. #BLOCK# Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and mix. Allow to set for an hour. #LABEL# -
Once your dough is ready, take it and begin make a dough snake. Best way to do this is to keep twisting and pulling gently on the dough.

You can also flatten the ball a bit, and poke your fist through the center and shape the wheel using a pulling and twisting motion; then cut the ring and straighten it (whichever method is easiest for you). Either way it helps to coat your hands in oil to help keep the dough from drying out as you work. You want the dough to be about an inch in diameter. #BLOCK# Mix the flour and water together.

Be rough with it, you want to stretch it and give it a good work out. Fold the dough in back towards you and turn 90 degrees. Repeat this procedure for the ten minutes. After a few minutes you should start to notice that the dough is getting a bit more elastic and easier to press out. The dough is ready when you are able to push lightly on it with your finger and it'll bounce back into shape, has no more stickyness to it, and is soft and smooth. Finally, cover the dough with a damp towel for 10 minutes. #LABEL# -
When you have your dough snake, cut it in 1/2 to 3/4 inch segments. #BLOCK# Once your dough is ready, take it and begin make a dough snake. Best way to do this is to keep twisting and pulling gently on the dough. Every now and then roll it on the counter (like rolling a cucumber) to keep it at even width. You can also flatten the ball a bit, and poke your fist through the center and shape the wheel using a pulling and twisting motion; then cut the ring and straighten it (whichever method is easiest for you). Either way it helps to coat your hands in oil to help keep the dough from drying out as you work. You want the dough to be about an inch in diameter. #LABEL# -

When kept for several days at room temperature in a loosely-closed container, the cookies become much softer and sticky. However, they still taste great!

Preserved Garlic. I started doing this a few years ago when I came by some really inexpensive, good-quality garlic. I bought enough of it that I knew I'd never use it before it got old, so I looked around for ways to keep it in usable form. Many people and sites I consulted suggested using olive oil, but oils do nothing to counter the growth of botulism. Instead I chose soy sauce. High in salt, soy sauce preserves garlic for longer than it takes me to use it, doesn't allow anything untoward to grow in it, and adds a fair amount of flavor besides. The garlic itself gets much more aromatic, but the individual cloves become less intense. When this jar opens, everyone in the neighborhood knows about it. And boy are they jealous. #LABEL# +

If it doesn't want to come out, you will need to use the pie scoop to make cuts over the lines the floss left. Before you make each cut with the pie scoop, clean off any cheesecake that is stuck on it using a paper towel and then run both sides of the scoop under hot water for 20 seconds or so. This will allow you to make clean cuts. If you desire, top your cheesecake with fruit or a fruit sauce. Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cherries are popular toppings. We topped our cheesecake with a homemade strawberry sauce and whipped cream. Here is our recipe for how to make the strawberry sauce. This same recipe can be used to make any of the popular fruit sauces. If you enjoyed this cheesecake recipe or have any questions for us, please leave us a comment using the form down below.

First, we need to make the dough - this is the most critical step. Drop one or two packets of yeast into a bowl. I use two, but you can get away with one.

Now, comes the hard part - Keep adding a little bit of flour (were talking pinches of it) and kneading the ball again and again, always adding a little bit more flower.

How do you know you've added enough? When you can make a nice fist sized ball that isn't sticky and - this is the best way to tell - is a little elastic. That is, when you push down on it and release it (ever so slightly, this isn't a slinky) comes back to its original shape.

You will need a rice cooker. You will need to wash the rice before cooking it, just to clean all the extra junk off of it. Run the rice in a strainer under cold water, until the water flowing through it runs clear. It doesn't take very long, and it tastes so much better. You'll want to measure out 1/4c of rice vinegar and dissolve the sugar into it. Add this to the 2c of water and washed rice in your rice cooker. Hit the switch to send it into cooking mode, and go do something else for a bit. When it's done cooking, you will have something that looks like this: Fresh out of the cooker, the rice will be too hot to handle, much less to form to make sushi. So, let it cool off until you can work with it. I suggest putting it under a fan, to speed the process. Don't let the rice go cold, though, it needs to retain a bit of warmth. Don't ask me why, it just does. #BLOCK# So, you'll need to have something to go on top of the rice. Pictured (clockwise from the top) are eel (unagi), tuna (maguro), an unidentified fish that was marked as salmon (sake), but didn't taste like it, and imitation crab, or fish cake. All, with the exception of the tuna, came from a Japanese market. The tuna was from a Central Market (which is owned by HEB). An important note: do not assume that fish is sushi-grade because it "looks good." Sushi-grade fish is checked for parasites, so make sure you check with whoever is behind the counter. If they don't know, don't buy it. #LABEL# +
So, let's start by making some nigiri, which is a small brick of rice with a slice of fish on top. First of all, get a bowl of water to wet your hands. I can't emphasize this enough! If you don't wet your hands between making pieces of sushi, you will never finish! Rice becomes stuck to your hands, and it turns into a huge, frustrating mess. You'll want to slice the fish up into pieces that are a little larger than 2" x 1/2". Thickness should be to your liking, though when they are thin, it's easier to eat. You also get more servings out of it. Any fish you have left after you've used up your rice can be eaten as sashimi, if you wish. #BLOCK# So, you'll need to have something to go on top of the rice.

A good guide for size is a 2" long by 1/2" wide and 1/2" tall brick. You don't really need to get a ruler out or anything, just go with something that seems about the right size to eat. Too big, and you'll have a hard time picking it up. Too small, and you'll have to eat about 30 pieces. If you clump the rice where your fingers meet your palm, and curl your fingers to square off the brick, it will give you approximately the right shape. It's hard to describe exactly how it's done, and I don't have any pictures of that step, so you'll have to experiment with what works for you. Compression of the rice is important, or it will fall apart when you try to eat. Once you have a brick ready, top it with a slice of fish that is just a little bit over-sized, so that it drapes slightly over the edges. Squeeze the fish and the rice together, so it won't fall off, and you're done. It may not look like what you see in a restaurant, but they've got more practice in than you. On the imitation crab rolls, I took a small strip of seaweed and wrapped it around the roll, to make it look awesome and to ensure the topping stays on. So, now that you've got making nigiri down, let's try some rolls, or norimake. These are what you see being served most often. It's a roll of fish or vegetables with a wrapping of seaweed (nori) on the outside. They're relatively easy to prepare, but take a lot of time compared to nigiri. For a normal-sized roll, you'll need to put a full sheet of seaweed out on a bamboo rolling mat. Protip: turn on a burner on your stove, and drag the seaweed across it a few times, to make it easier to work with and less likely to split. Spread rice thinly across the seaweed with your hands (remember to wet them down often), making sure not to leave gaps in the middle, but do not pack the rice down, rolling it will take care of that for you. You'll want to put a line of whatever is to be in the roll down the bottom side of the seaweed, leaving enough room to start the roll. It will look something like this: #BLOCK# So, let's start by making some nigiri, which is a small brick of rice with a slice of fish on top. First of all, get a bowl of water to wet your hands. I can't emphasize this enough! If you don't wet your hands between making pieces of sushi, you will never finish! Rice becomes stuck to your hands, and it turns into a huge, frustrating mess. You'll want to slice the fish up into pieces that are a little larger than 2" x 1/2". Thickness should be to your liking, though when they are thin, it's easier to eat. You also get more servings out of it. Any fish you have left after you've used up your rice can be eaten as sashimi, if you wish. #LABEL# -
A good guide for size is a 2" long by 1/2" wide and 1/2" tall brick. You don't really need to get a ruler out or anything, just go with something that seems about the right size to eat. Too big, and you'll have a hard time picking it up. Too small, and you'll have to eat about 30 pieces. If you clump the rice where your fingers meet your palm, and curl your fingers to square off the brick, it will give you approximately the right shape. It's hard to describe exactly how it's done, and I don't have any pictures of that step, so you'll have to experiment with what works for you.

It will look something like this: #BLOCK# Pictured here is a California roll, minus the fish, with some rolls of fish eggs to the side. I didn't have any tuna left over from the nigiri, so we just used cucumber and avocado. Really, you can add almost anything to these rolls, so long as you slice it up to fit on the seaweed. To begin the roll, grab the edge closest to you, and curl it over the bulk of the ingredients. Once you've got it over, you can start using the mat to roll, like this: #LABEL# +

From there, cut the roll in half, and those halves in half again. You should end up with 8 rolls of a good size, though the two end rolls may be a little bit deflated. I usually just eat them before serving. Tasty! You can see in one of the above pictures that I also have rolls that I made with roe, or fish eggs. It's really very simple to make these, just lay out the seaweed and rice as if you were making a normal roll, spread the eggs across, roll, and top with a bit more. I also made some rolls with what was left of the imitation crab, and they turned out really well. #BLOCK# It helps if you wet down the back edge of the seaweed, to make the roll stay shut. #LABEL# -

I've got a 5lb pork shoulder, the boston butt. You'll sometimes see a "picnic" labeled as shoulder too, but that's more arm than shoulder, so avoid that because its got a lot of gristle in it.

Macerated Strawberries:Slice the strawberries as desired and mix with the sugar. Stir occasionally for 15-20 minutes, then chill until serving time. The strawberries will release more juice as time goes on. #BLOCK# Candied Barley:Cook the barley in a rice cooker or over the stove. Typical stovetop cooking time is around 45 minutes to an hour. Once the barley is cooked (but preferably still warm), put the sugar into a saute pan over medium-high heat. Shake frequently, and begin stirring as the sugar liquefies. Once it browns a bit, add the butter and stir until the butter has melted and the caramel is fully liquid. Add the vanilla extract and stir to combine. #LABEL# +
Add the still-warm barley. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently. The caramel is likely to seize up into chunks when the barley is added, but dedicated stirring and cooking will cause it to relax and coat each grain of barley. Once most of the caramel has applied itself to the barley, move to a baking sheet. If you let this cool, it will get somewhat soggy. For that reason I recommend assembling the dessert immediately after candying the barley. If you need to do this in advance, a quick refresh in a hot pan will restore some of the crunch (but also dry out the barley somewhat). #BLOCK# Assembly:Unmold the peanut butter gelatin (hot water over the bottom of the pan helps with this) and cut out small rounds with whatever round-thing- cutting apparatus you have. #LABEL# +
Plate, beginning with gelatin, then a nice layer of still-warm barley, then the second layer of gelatin. Top and garnish with macerated strawberries. The barley will melt a bit of the gelatin, leaving the inside of the dessert soft and gooey while the outside remains nicely firm. Crunchy bits of caramel stuck to the barley adds another textural contrast. #BLOCK# Assembly:Unmold the peanut butter gelatin (hot water over the bottom of the pan helps with this) and cut out small rounds with whatever round-thing- cutting apparatus you have. #LABEL# -

Making the Pizza Easiest way is to flatten the dough in the center of a lightly oiled pizza pan, and just keep working it until you get to the edge. Go over the edge a little bit and fold the dough back to create your crust. Or you can choose to go the advanced way and hand-toss your dough. It's really up to you to devise a method that works for you. For myself I'll play with the dough a bit, slamming it into the counter and rounding it out into a disk. Once it's about 6 inches in diameter, I'll form my crust by taking the outer edges and pinching the crust onto it using a rope-pulling fashion. This also helps enlarge the disk as gravity pulls on the bottom of it. Once I'm satisfied with the crust, and before my dough turns into a donut, I'll flip it up into the air using my left hand sort of like a pivot, and my right to actually turn the dough. Once it is large enough, I'll place it on the pan, and rough out the edges. If your dough is made correctly (elastic and flexible), you should have no problem hand tossing your dough once you get a system down. Lightly brush some olive oil on the dough, and sprinkle some oregano, basil, and parmeasean cheese on it. #BLOCK# Preparing the ToppingsMushrooms: Season the Shitake mushrooms in simmering chicken stock for 30 minutes.

Boil the noodles in a large pot of water. I usually use about 3/4 of a 16 oz package. A lot of people add oil to the water to keep the noodles from sticking together.

I'll be using three small potatoes, which should yield about 6 medium-sized pancakes. Since I've had them for a while, I'm going to peel them. You don't have to. It's up to you. #BLOCK# At this point, you can put some oil in the pan and get it heating up on medium heat. You don't need to completely cover the pancakes and deep-fry them. There should be enough oil for them to sit nicely in, though. Next, grate them taters. Since I'm a poor recent college graduate, I just use a cheese grater. It works, but if you're doing a large batch, your arm may get very tired. My parents typically use a food processor with the grating attachment, but whatever works for you. Then crack an egg into the bowl and toss in a little flour. You don't need much flour. Just enough to make the potatoes stick together. Add more if you want them more pancake-like, less if you want them more hash brown-like. Stir it all up until it's well mixed. #LABEL# +

When they're done, take them out and drain the water. We'll be using milk and butter for these potatoes, not the potato water. You can tell when they're done when the middle isn't hard and raw-potatoey anymore. Go ahead and cut one in half if you can't tell by looking. #BLOCK# You will also need: a large pot a large frying pan or griddle of some sort (at least 9 inch bottom diameter) a mixer or a potato masher a bowl and plastic wrap or Tupperware a flat surface big enough to knead on a rolling pin a spatula First, peel your potatoes. The fresher they are, the easier this is to do and the less nasty they will be. If your potato has things growing out of it and you absolutely can't get a new one, cut them out and don't eat them for the love of god. Cut out all remaining black spots and cut them in half or until they're about evenly sized. This is so they all cook at the same speed. Now put them into a big pot and fill it with water to cover them. Put some salt in, around a teaspoon or so. Now cover the pot, and go do something else for a while. #LABEL# -
Now, if you're lazy like me, you'll use a stand mixer to mash the potatoes, like so: If not, you can go at them with a potato masher or a fork, whatever.

Now you need to divide it into eight pieces and ball it up. I do it like this: #BLOCK# But whatever floats your boat, so long as you get eight equally sized little balls of dough out of it. Spread more flour out onto your surface - no, more. Lefse loves getting stuck when you roll it out, it's infuriating. The best way to avoid it is to flip the dough over every time you take a roll on the rolling pin, flick a little more flour under it, and then roll the other side. Always keep your rolling pin well floured, too. You want really thin pieces here, absolutely no thicker than your average flour tortilla, otherwise they won't cook all the way through and will taste a little doughy. They should work out to be about nine inches diameter. #LABEL# +
Once you have all eight pieces rolled out, heat up your frying pan or griddle or whatever and grease it slightly if it isn't non-stick. Non-stick is great for this purpose, though. Flip one of the uncooked lefse into the pan and quickly unfold any creases that might have happened with the spatula. You only turn lefse once, and you do it when you see air bubbles forming under the lefse like I circled in blue here: #BLOCK# When you flip it, the finished side will look like this: #LABEL# +
It won't need to cook for as long on the other side, but it will do the bubble trick again (harder to see this time, careful not to leave it on too long and burn it!) or you can just pick it up with the spatula and check underneath.

Making the Sauce: Just so you know what you're getting into, we're going to be making our fish base with lots of rosemary to give it sort of a piney flavor, and then boil away all the extra liquid and reduce it into a modified version of fish veloute sauce. Saute the lobster shells and legs, tomatoes, onions, 6 sprigs of rosemary, tarragon, bay leaves and carrots in olive oil until the carrots are tender.

To zest an orange, you want to lightly scrape off with a grater the outermost layer of skin.

The orange won't last long without its skin, by the way, so you should eat it soon. Also, the easiest way to measure out the 1-3/4 cups of sour cream, is to take a 2 cup package, reserve 1/4 cup of it, and dump the rest into a bowl.

And if you want to avoid opening the door entirely, put the pan in a water bath. (This means place it in a large pan with about 1/2 inch of water in it. This will soften the heat, and keep the top of the cake moist. Alternately, you can use a baking stone.) If you're using a springform pan, only use a water bath if you have lined the bottom with foil, and have enough extra to fold up along the edges of the pan. Otherwise, water will leak into your cake through the gaps in the bottom of the pan! #LABEL# +
After the first hour has gone by (and you've opened the door four times, now) go ahead and keep the door closed, baking it for one more hour. I've seen a lot of cheesecake recipes that bake for a much shorter time than this. Trust me, the cake will come out perfect. Also, it may "rise" a bit in the oven -- don't worry, it'll settle back down when it cools. How to tell when the cake is done? It will be lightly browned around the edges, but stil soft and jiggly in the middle. A toothpick inserted near the edge will come out clean, but near the center will come out with cake batter on it. And here it is, very slightly brown around the edges (the brown doesn't show up as well against orange), a little wobbly in the center. Carryover will take it the rest of the way. When it gets to this point, remove it from the oven, and place on a cooling rack for one hour. Do not place it directly in the fridge! The heat that it's hanging onto will finish cooking the middle of the cake, without overcooking the edges. Once an hour has passed, place the cake in your fridge for at least six hours before removing from the pan. #BLOCK# Carefully pour the colored mix into the pan, and spread it evenly over the first half. Place the whole thing in the oven, and set your timer for 15 minutes. This is going to take a lot longer than 15 minutes to bake.

And here it is, finally out of the pan. The orange layer doesn't show up as well in the picture, but it looks really nice laying on a plate.

Put the 1/4 cup of Apricot Jam and 1tbsp of Orange Juice in a small sauce pan over medium low heat. (Why Apricot jam? Because orange would be too overpowering. Apricot has a sweeter, less acidic flavor that won't overpower the mandarin orange slices, or the cake.) While that's melting, take a moment to drain the mandarin orange slices and pat them dry with a paper towel. #BLOCK# Take your remaining crushed graham crackers, and press them into the sides of the cake.

Once the butter is melted, add your garlic, the juice of half a lemon or lime, the tablespoon of oregano, and 1/2 a cup of white wine. Dried oregano is fine for this dish. When working with dried herbs, I always crunch it up in my hand before I add them.

I usually get a couple soft baguette style loaves from a local subway type sandwich shop. What I do is hollow out each side of the baguette by scraping the extra bread out. This forms a nice trough to hold the meat and sauce. Now, since the meat is soft, I toast the bread so that there is a nice contrast in texture. It really does make all the difference. Once the bread is toasted, scoop some meat into the trough you created in your bread. Then top your meatball sub sandwich with as much freshly grated mozzarella and parmesan cheese as you want.

Open up your pickled ginger and pull out the longest and widest pieces. #BLOCK# Variant 1: Prosciutto StyleThis works best with the longer, thinner pieces of ginger. Starting at one end of a melon piece, wrap your ginger around the melon once or twice. If you come up short, overlap a couple of pieces to get a proper amount of wrapping done. Distribute some sel gris long the top of the roll. #LABEL# +
Variant 2: Sushi StyleThis is a better method for the short, wide pieces of ginger. Lay a single piece along the top of the melon, like a piece of sashimi goes onto rice. Top with a cluster of sel gris in the middle of the "sashimi." #BLOCK# Plated: #LABEL# +

They're wonderful because they keep virtually forever, are reasonably easy to work with, and add a huge amount of flavor. To really gain access to that flavor we need to rehydrate them. First, cut off the top of the chile. I like to use a scissors or kitchen shears for this. Shake out as many loose seeds as you can.

Actually, forgo the milk for the first cookie so you can get a feel for how the Nutella has altered the taste. It's not a huge change, but it is noticeable. You still taste the peanut butter, but now there's hazelnut and chocolate there as well.

Using a tablespoon scoop, scoop 2 tablespoons of the oatmeal raisin cookie dough into your hands and roll the dough into a ball. Place the ball of dough onto the parchment paper. You want to make all the dough balls this same size. You shouldn't need the tablespoon measure to help you any longer. You want to place each ball of dough to have about 2 inches of spacing. Each baking tray should hold 12 cookies. Place the baking sheets into the oven and cook your oatmeal raisin cookies at 350º Fahrenheit for 22-25 minutes, switching and rotating the pans at the halfway point to insure that the oatmeal raisin cookies cook evenly. You want to remove the cookies when they have a golden brown color around the edges. Since oven temperature can vary by a wide margin, keep an eye on them. Once removed from the oven, allow the oatmeal raisin cookies to cool on the trays for a couple minutes before moving them onto a plate.

Just a heads up - Substituting salsa for the tomato sauce is very good if you want a little extra kick to your meatloaf. Adding chopped onions to the overall mixture is also very nice. Mix the eggs up in a small bowl or a food processor. Combine the ground beef, four or five shots of worcestershire sauce, the eggs, the tomato sauce, and the bread crumbs in a large bowl. Keep the ketchup to the side for now. Mix it all up with your hands until it becomes somewhat thick. Once it's thick you can form the 'loaves' on a baking sheet. When you have the loaves formed add a layer of ketchup to the top as if it were icing. Add pepper or garlic powder if you want to. Since I had two pounds of ground beef I made two loaves as shown in this picture: Now put it in the oven for one hour at 375F. Ovens are obviously all different but meatloaf is hard to mess up. If you're unsure of whether or not it is done you can insert a fork in it. If the fork comes out clean it's probably done. You should also notice, when it's nearing completion, that the edges will be browning. Since you have an hour to kill you can go ahead and start working on mashed potatoes, corn, etc. #BLOCK# Once an hour has passed you can remove it. Here's a picture of my two huge mounds meatloaf deliciousness: #LABEL# +

If you don't have a creole seasoning on hand, you can make your own batch by mixing the following ingredients together:Creole Seasoning:2 1/2 tablespoons paprika1 tablespoon dried oregano2 tablespoons garlic powder1 tablespoon black pepper1 tablespoon onion powder2 tablespoons salt1 tablespoon cayenne pepper1 tablespoon dried thymeNote:You're not using all that on the fish! You will only be using a tablespoon of the mix, so store the rest away in a jar. Rinse the catfish fillets under cool running water and then pat them dry using paper towels. A dry fish will hold onto the spices and marinate better. Put the catfish fillets in a couple of long containers or baking dishes. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of creole seasoning evenly over one side of each of the catfish fillets. If you find that the much of the flesh of a fish isn't covered feel free to use more seasoning. #BLOCK# Add the lemon juice, garlic and parsley evenly over the fillets. Move the catfish fillets around, and flip them so that the catfish is evenly coated. Note:The lemon juice will really brighten up the taste of the catfish and remove any musty smell or taste. If you normally don't add a squeeze of lemon to your freshwater fish when eating at seafood restaurants, I would suggest using a little more than half of the amount listed above. You can always squeeze more lemon on after the catfish has been cooked!Let the fish marinate at room temperature for 10 minutes. #LABEL# +
Once the catfish has finished marinating, dredge each catfish fillet into the cornmeal mixture. Flip each fillet around to evenly coat it and then gently shake off any excess.

In either case, when your pie still looks like this: IT IS NOT DONE YET. See all that tan-colored "foam"? That needs to mostly go away before you take it out of the oven. This is all of the air bubbling out of the pie so that it may have a smooth, caramely texture. At least I assume so. Another way of checking the doneness of the pie is this: take the cookie sheet and move it a bit. Did the pie jiggle like a Jello mold? Are the pecans bulging over the top? If so, wait another few minutes before taking the pie out of the oven. When the pie has fell back to a normal position and you start seeing clear bubbles rise from the filling, chances are it's done. #BLOCK# Ah, yes.

On the grill is good, but you can only eat that so long before you want something different. Enter poaching. Poaching fish is incredibly easy, quite delicious, and very fast to make. It is also very versatile in how you make it. I made it this time with white cooking wine. In the past I've made it with lemon juice and chicken broth. Different liquids will affect the flavor in different ways. It's fun to experiment. Also, try different fish. Today, I made Tilapia. I've also made Salmon this way. The thing with Salmon or other thick fish steak is that it will take longer. Tilapia, being a thin cut, finishes in 5-10 minutes.

This is a planer. You use it to make zest out of the peel to your lime. The side of a cheese grater with the smallest holes will work, too. Make about 1/2 tsp of the glorious stuff. #BLOCK# First, peel and dice your mangoes. Dicing mangoes is a pain, because they have a very hard center. I wouldn't call it a pit exactly, as a superdense chunk of Adamentium. The easiest way is to peel it, make slits to the core in circles around the mango, and then cut the sides off near the pit. Next is to add roughly 4 tbsp of chopped red onion to the mango in a large bowl. The easiest way to chop an onion is to cut the small end off, and make cuts down until you're almost to the other end, but not all the way. Do the cuts one way, then the other, to make a grid pattern. Then cut down against the cuts to have a pile of perfectly chopped onions. #LABEL# -

The first problem is how to slice the potato thin enough. The answer is with The Cheese Plane. Not only is it an indispensable tool for the cheese enthusiast, it makes perfectly thin potato slices! In case you've never seen a cheese plane, here it is - excuse the potato juice. You can either hold the potato in your hand and slice along the top of it (what I did for the first few batches) but this has a nasty habit of also slicing your fingers when the potato half gets a bit small. The painfully obvious solution is to flip the plane over and set it down - then just push the potato against the blade. No more wastage and no more blood. #BLOCK# Throw the slices into water to prevent them blackening, and give them about 5-10 minutes to rest. Then put them onto paper towels to drain. Making a lot is a little time consuming but you know how quickly you can eat all the chips so just keep slicing.

Prepare them in batches, don't try and fry them all at once (unless you've got some kind of huge deep fat fryer, or a massive pot of oil).

Of course you can season the potato chips with whatever you wish, but for these I wanted to try and recreate the chicken &amp; thyme flavor crisps which I love so much. Where do you obtain chicken flavoring? easy - stock (bouillon) cubes! Strangely this tastes almost identical to the chicken flavored crisps I can buy in a store. I just crushed down a cube, added some hot chili powder, some dried thyme and a little onion salt. Of course you could just keep it old school and add salt, but you're pretty much only limited by your imagination here. Just put all your cooked potato chips into a big bowl and use a spoon to add the desired amount of flavoring. How much depends on how much you like the flavor being added, toss the chips around a bit and shake the bowl to get the excess to settle to the bottom. Take a sample chip every now and then to judge if you've got the right amount. #LABEL# -

This is my mise en place; all the ingredients are ready to go. Keep the potatoes in water so that they don't discolor. The slivered leeks are soaking in water.

Once you're done, you'll be left with a bowl of sifted powder. Put this bowl aside for now, we'll come back to it later. #BLOCK# Hardware:- Large mixing bowl - Medium-sized mixing bowl - Flour sifter - Cooling rack - Rubber spatula - Bundt pan (The round pan with the hole in the middle. If yours is new and nonstick, you can get away without greasing it. If not, spray the inside of the pan with some nonstick cooking spray such as Pam.) - Electric mixer of some kind - Toothpicks (not pictured) - Oven, preheated to 350 degrees F (if you live halfway up to the moon in altitude, I have no idea what to tell you). First, using the flour sifter and the smaller mixing bowl, sift together the flour, salt, and baking powder. You can put the first cup of flour in the sifter, then put the salt and baking powder on top, then the rest of the flour as you sift it into the bowl. #LABEL# -

If you don't have a standing mixer or at least a handheld, this is going to be very very hard to make. #BLOCK# The amounts I use in the pictures will be different, but I'm making two batches to take to work. If you don't have an espresso machine, you can brew a strong cup of coffee, and then run the coffee through your machine again over new grounds. If you do that, be sure to run a pot or two of just water through your machine to clean it out afterwords. Mascarpone cheese is a creamy cheese, like a softer cream cheese. It's sweet, and I've found it at both Meijer's and Giant Eagle, usually in little tubs near the fancy cheeses. Marsala is a wine, but if you're cheap or can't find any, you can substitute Frangelica or Kahlua, but a bottle of Marsala is like 4 bucks at the grocery, and it's usually kept near the sherry. Ladyfingers are hard little cookie things, that I've also found at Meijer's and Giant Eagle. If you can only find the soft kind, it's OK, but it works better with the hard kind. Brew up your coffee and let it cool completely. If you're making espresso, realize that it will take quite a bit of time to finish. Separate your eggs, discarding the whites on two of them. You can separate your eggs with a tablespoon, or whatever you find easiest. You should have 6 yolks, and 4 whites. Lay out all your ingredients, for ease of use.

Figure out what kind of dish you want to make your tiramisu in. I am making them in covered casseroles, but that's only because they'll be the easiest to take to work. You can do them in a glass dish, or a springform pan. The only change will be how you arrange your ladyfingers. Dip your ladyfingers, one at a time, into your cooled espresso. There's a science to this, as you want them to be soft but not falling apart. If you are using soft ladyfingers, brush the coffee on with a pastry brush. If you are using hard like I am, I find two quick dunks in does the trick. Be sure the whole ladyfingers is moist, and let the coffee drain out for a few seconds before laying them in your dish. Figure out your pattern that will make the most sense, and make one layer of dunked ladyfingers: #BLOCK# You want some room for expansion and the filling to sit. I put the 4 vertical ones in to fill space and lend support. When you have a layer, place a layer of your mascarpone mix on it, and smooth it out. #LABEL# +

Place a third layer of ladyfingers, and then your final layer of mascarpone, and more cocoa. If you didn't like cocoa in each layer like I do, you would still want to put it on top. Now, cover and refrigerate for at least two hours, and preferably overnight. That will stiffen up the cheese layers immensely, and all the flavors will blend nicely. Be sure to keep it cold, too, since it does contain raw eggs. I don't have any pictures of it cut, since they both go to work with me tonight.

I had never made red bean steamed buns before but I figured I'd give it a shot. Making the bean paste took the better part of a day but it wasn't constant work, merely checking it out occasionally.

Cut half inch grooves all around the roast, which will allow the flavors of the seasoning to penetrate, and the fat on the back to render. #BLOCK# You will also need a meat thermometer. To begin with, prep the lamb by removing any silverskin, membranes, or excess fat. - Note, do not remove the fat that covers the entire back side of the roast. Preheat oven to 400F. #LABEL# -
Mix 1 Tbsp cumin, a Tsp or two of ground pepper, Rosemary, Thyme, 4 Cloves garlic, and pat the entire roast down, working seasonings into the grooves. After, salt the entire roast with a reasonable amount of salt. Set in roasting pan on top of a grill rack of some sort. I had no such rack, so I innovated and used two whisks to support the roast. (This is really important, you want the roast off the pan both for drippings and even browning of the roast!) Also, drizzle with 1 tbsp olive oil. #BLOCK# Cut half inch grooves all around the roast, which will allow the flavors of the seasoning to penetrate, and the fat on the back to render. #LABEL# -

If you don't have a scraper you can just dust your hands with flour and use them instead. At this point, now would be a good time to pre-heat your oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. #LABEL# -

You can do this on your tabletop or you can try to do it the way you may have seen pretzel makers do it at the mall. The way they do it at the mall is by holding both ends up so the dough is in the air, making a "U" shape. Now, keeping your left arm still, use your right hand to lasso the dough around the other strand and then drop the dough onto the table while still holding the ends. Then pinch the ends you are holding onto the outer ring of the dough. For a good video demonstration of this technique,click here. #LABEL# +
While traditional German pretzel are made by dipping them in a lye solution to develop a deep, rich mahogany color, and a unique outer skin and flavor, we will instead use baking soda. Baking soda is much safer to use than lye as the PH is much lower. Lye is extremely caustic and can burn through your skin (ever see the movie Fight Club?), blind you, as well as chew up your kitchen table. Baking soda will still give you a really nice color, it just won't be a deep, rich mahogany color like you would get with lye. Baking soda is also what the pretzel shops in the mall use (Auntie Anne's, Pretzelmaker, etc).In a 9x13" baking dish, add 4 cups of warm water. Then slowly add in 1/2 cup of baking soda while mixing with a spoon. Be sure to try and and fully dissolve the baking soda into the water to make a solution. If a layer of baking soda remains at the bottom and you can't get it to dissolve, then that's ok. Just do your best to mix it really well. #BLOCK# Once you have 8 long ropes of dough, you can shape them into pretzels like shown in the photo.

Here are some of my pretzels on my baking sheet about to go into the oven. I was only able to get 2-3 pretzels on each baking pan. At this point you can top your pretzels with coarse kosher salt or pretzel salt. If you are making cinnamon-sugar pretzels, omit the salt. You want to bake the pretzels at 425 degrees Fahreinheit for 4 minutes, and then spin the pan around in the oven and bake for another 3 to 4 minutes. I found that after spinning the pan around, 3 minutes and 30 seconds gave me the best color. Your oven may differ. As soon as you see a nice golden brown color, take them out right away. At this point you can dip the pretzels into a baking pan of melted butter or you can brush melted butter onto the pretzels. If you want to add a cinnamon-sugar coating on top of the butter, mix a half of a cup of sugar in a baking pan with a couple tablespoons of cinnamon. Then just dip the pretzels into the mixture. Tip:Pretzels will get stale within a day. Be sure to eat them right out of the oven. Also, I found that the thinner pretzels tasted the best as they had a really nice crispiness on the outside while still being soft inside. Pretzel Toppings:Other possible pretzel toppings include: parmesan cheese, garlic seasoning, caramel with almonds, cinnamon-sugar with cream cheese icing, sesame seeds, poppy seeds, or bacon pieces. Pretzel Dips:Some dips that you could make that would go well with the pretzel: mustard, honey mustard, marinara sauce, nacho cheese, cheddar cheese, cream cheese, icing. Please do leave a comment and let us know how your pretzels turned out and if you have any suggestions for improvement of this recipe. History of Pretzels / Pretzel FactsPretzels are said to have originated from Italian monks around 610 A. D. The monks would form their scraps of dough into the shape of children's arms crossed in prayer over their chests (the twist) centered between three rings representing the holy trinity. When the children learned their bible versus or prayers they were given these pretzels as a "pretiola", which in latin means "little reward". The pretzels worked so well as a delicious reward that even adults loved them. The adults called them brachiola or "little arms". Soon they were being made in other parts of Europe, particularly Germany, where the pretzel shape came to represent good luck and good fortune. This is also where lye was first used when a baker accidently dropped pretzels in a lye cleaning solution and baked them anyway. To the bakers astonishment, the lye gave the pretzels a great color, texture, and flavor. It has become a tradition for a pretzel to be hung around a child's neck by a string during New Years celebrations in Germany. Some Austrians even top their Christmas tree with a pretzel!The Danish call their salty pretzels saltkringler, with Kringle being the name for the pretzel shape. An actual Kringle is a sweet pastry in the shape of pretzel. While the word "kringle" may make you think of Kris Kringle, the Santa Claus character in the movie Miracle on 34th Street, it had nothing to do with the sweet pastry. The first commercial pretzel bakery in the United States was started by Julius Sturgis in Lititz, Pennsylvania, in 1861. The legend is that Julius was approached by a homeless man looking for work in his bakery. Although there were no jobs available, Julius provided the man with a free dinner. As a thank you, the homeless man gave him a pretzel recipe. After testing the recipe, it became so popular that Julius converted his bakery to only make pretzels. The Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery is still in business today at the same location.

Now on to the actual cooking. Find a fairly large, preferably non-stick, pot and chuck some oil into the bottom of it. Then pop your potatoes and carrots in there and fry them up a little on high until they get some color. If you have decided to have quite large chunks of capsicum you may want to add it at this stage - otherwise leave it till later. This will probably need a fair bit of stirring so don't go wandering off at this stage - there will be plenty of time for that later. #BLOCK# I didn't use - but would recommend - an onion and some Soy sauce as well. If you are using onions chop them up with everything else and fry them a little before chucking the other veggies in the pot - but not for too long because you don't want burned onion. Start by peeling the potatoes and carrots (you may not have to if they are clean and fresh and depending on what you like). Then cut the Potatoes into cubes - the size doesn't matter as long as you are consistent. Usually chunky is good but smaller may be handy if dinner needs to be done more quickly. Slice the carrot into fairly thick slices and dice up your capsicum. I cut my capsicum very finely because I don't like eating large chunks of it but capsicum lovers would probably prefer larger bits. Finally cut the chili very finely - you may want to consider wearing gloves to do this or otherwise your hands will be very spicy for quite a while afterwords which could becomes unpleasant if you get itchy eyes or something. Having cut everything up it should look somewhat like this (note that there's capsicum in my photo this time). #LABEL# -

Stir everything up and then stick a lid on the pot and leave everything to cook. Check in occasionally - it's done once your potatoes and carrots are soft. Make sure you've added enough water or add some extra if too much is evaporating - it is meant to be soup after all. Once things have been cooking for a while it is also a good time to check the flavor. Add whatever is missing (in my case it was mostly salt).

Now, for the couscous! This stuff is just like rice or noodles, doesn't taste much by itself so it's all about how you flavor it. First, peel the carrots and remove the seeds from the paprika. Also peel two garlic cloves. Depending on how much you like garlic you might want to go easy on it, I happen to think it's the greatest spice ever invented so I use a lot of it. You should keep in mind that the sausage also contains a fair amount of garlic. #BLOCK# In the oven they go #LABEL# -

How to cook spinach:Place the spinach in the pan (if you are using more spinach than I am, you may have to pack it down) and move the spinach around so that the spinach is coated with the oil and garlic. Put a lid over the pan for one minute to steam. #BLOCK# Spinach cooks down a lot. A 1 lb bag of spinach will feed about four people as a side. For this recipe, I'm only using a 5 ounce box of spinach, and 1 clove of garlic. This is enough for one person. For a family of four, use a 1 lb bag of spinach and 2-3 garlic cloves. Fill a large bowl with water. Submerge spinach in the water and agitate to remove any dirt particles. Remove spinach from water and use a salad spinner or paper towels to remove any excess water from the spinach. Add olive oil to a large saute pan. On medium-high heat, saute your sliced garlic for about one minute, or until the garlic is just starting to brown. #LABEL# -
Remove lid. Stir and flip spinach. If all the spinach leaves have not wilted, place the lid back on and steam for another minute. After all leaves have wilted, drain off any excess water from the pan into the sink. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil over the spinach. Stir. Add salt to taste. Serve. Some additional ideas that will add flavor to the spinach:Instead of using olive oil, add some southern flair by cooking the spinach in bacon grease and add bits of bacon to the cooked spinach. You can also add a small amount of butter to the pan before you put the cover on for the second time. A squirt of lemon juice would be great. If you like spice, try adding some red pepper flakes.

I admit, I am taking a different step towards making the stock. Usually I cook everything together, but one of the chefs at work was telling me it's better when you do just the chicken and add the mirepoix at the end. He claims the flavor gets wasted in the broth when it simmers for too long. So I'm giving this a try and seeing if it makes any difference. Chop the chicken up into 4 inch pieces, cutting through the bones. Place the chicken and water into a stockpot and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 4 hours. #BLOCK# Make your sachet by wrapping herbs in cheesecloth. I used a mixture of bay leaves, cracked peppercorns, thyme, rosemary, cumin, herbs de province, and chervil.

Then dump the meat in, and stir it for maybe 30 second or so until it's well- coated with sauce. It's very important that you keep stirring and do it pretty fast, I managed to burn the meat pretty good on my first attempt. The good news is that even if you burn things a bit, the taste of the sauce is strong enough to largely mask the taste. #BLOCK# You can put the pineapple in at the same time if you want, but the oil doesn't take too well to the moisute, so I'd recommend adding the sauce and then the pineapple. I use maybe 6-8 chunks, it just depends on how much you want. Keep stirring, don't let the sauce burn. Should take less than a minute or so. You can see some of the stuff is slightly scorched, that's what happens when you stop stirring to take pictures. #LABEL# -
After 30-40 seconds, go ahead and dump it into whatever you're eating or serving from. I tried it over rice first, but honestly, you really don't need rice when you've got all that fried meat. You can see there's quite a bit of excess sauce, so fortunately that means you're not actually eating all 5 tablespoons of sugar. You could probably make 2-3 times and much without making more sauce. Anyway, please leave any questions or further tips. This was only the third time I've ever made it and the first thing I've ever cooked in a wok, but it was so simple I thought I'd share.

Peel the outer skin of the carrot away using a potato peeler. Grate the carrot into a bowl using a microplane. Place the peeled whole tomatos and their juice into a large bowl.

Stir in red pepper flakes for a little bit of heat. This will give the sauce some zing. Taste the sauce. Add salt if needed. If the tomato sauce is a bit tart or acidic, add about 3/4 of a teaspoon of sugar. Stir well and taste again to see if it needs anymore. Add a few chopped or shredded basil leaves and stir well. It's important to add soft herbs like basil at the end of the cooking process to prevent the sauce from becoming bitter. This sauce is a bit thick and chunky. It would be a great on rigatoni and topped with freshly grated parmesan cheese. If you want to make a smoother sauce, just use an immersion blender to thin it out. The tomato sauce will keep in the fridge for about 4 days. To keep the tomato sauce longer, put it into small containers and place in the freezer. Using small containers allows you to easily reheat single servings as needed whenever you need a delicious pasta sauce.

Take the basil and put it in a blender-suitable container like a measuring cup (or if you have it, a stationary blender) Blend the basil along with shredded Parmesan cheese. Add olive oil, salt and black pepper. Mix it good. #LABEL# -

Once your stir fry reaches this stage (3 or so minutes), you should notice a few things.

When making this white chocolate cheesecake, I make a raspberry sauce to go with it. I kind of hacked the sauce together, but basically it involves heating strained raspberries (no pulp), some sugar, lime juice, and some cornstarch. I didn't take pictures of that part, since I'm not sure how best to do the sauce, and mine came out a bit sweet for my tastes. You can do other things like add butterscotch, make a lemon curd, or somehow get some pumpkin in there if you don't want to do white chocolate. When you're ready, run a knife around the outside, and remove the pan sides by releasing the spring. Cut it with a hot knife (dip in hot water then wipe), and enjoy!

Pour some oatmeal into a bowl. #BLOCK# I used this much oatmeal, it varies - I actually probably should have used a little more oatmeal and a little less maypo wheat this time. #LABEL# +

IMPORTANT: start saturating the Yotemeal NOW with milk. If you don't, once the next steps are completed you'll be stuck with an impermeable milk membrane that will keep the oatmeal from getting milk contact. ADD CAREFULLY as to not disrupt laying! #BLOCK# Brown sugar ruffly distributed on top of the maypo wheat: #LABEL# -
Next, add a good sized layer of yogurt. This is the best part of the food, and adds the most to the flavor. So be liberal. #BLOCK# IMPORTANT: start saturating the Yotemeal NOW with milk.

The shrimp is pretty expensive, even that little. If you want to get something cheaper (I used cocktail shrimp here, because I got them for really cheap), go ahead. Fresh, de-tailed shrimp is the my favorite to get, but frozen, pre- cooked tailed shrimp is the cheapest. I highly recommend using store bought spaghetti sauce for this because you don't need a whole lot and really, it's just more expensive and more trouble than it's worth to make your own. Fresh peppers are recommended, but hey, a buck for a pound and a half of frozen ones. Can't beat that. Dice the veggies. Use quantities that you prefer, there isn't really a "good" amount. A handful and a half of mushrooms, a handful of onion, and a half of a tomato are my measurements. If you're using fresh peppers, go ahead and do those now. Wash those mushrooms, while you're at it. #BLOCK# Next we cut off the tails of the shrimp. #LABEL# +
Also, lightly coat your largest pan/skillet with the olive oil, heat it over medium-high and toss in the shrimp. If you have uncooked shrimp, wait until it's opaque and orange here. Don't overcook them because they'll be in the pan a long time. #BLOCK# And this is what a delicious properly cooked shrimp looks like: #LABEL# +
When your shrimp is cooked or near enough, DRAIN THE PAN, dump in some more olive oil, and toss in the tomato, onion, and mushrooms. Coat them with your desired spices, but do NOT put in more than a tiny bit of garlic. It really doesn't taste good in large quantities here. I load up on Cayenne, because I like that stuff. #BLOCK# And this is what a delicious properly cooked shrimp looks like: #LABEL# -
Turn the heat up to medium/high, spread the oil and spices around a bit and you should have something looking about like this after a few minutes (don't do this for more than two or three minutes): #BLOCK# When your shrimp is cooked or near enough, DRAIN THE PAN, dump in some more olive oil, and toss in the tomato, onion, and mushrooms.

Drain the pan after a minute or two, and move aside the vegetables and shrimp. Put a little bit more oil (yeah, I know) on the empty half and toss your FULLY COOKED fettuccine in. If your fettuccine is still cooking at this point, just drain the pan and set it aside, don't put it back on the burner and wait for the pasta to finish. #BLOCK# Do the same thing to the peppers, too.

Melt butter in a saute pan, and brown the beef. #BLOCK# Basically you'll need good beef, butter, onions, green peppers &amp; hot peppers, and some spices. I like to use sirloin beef from Aldi (which seems to be much thicker and more tender than your average grocery store thin steak - don't laugh!). Dice the onions &amp; green peppers, and assemble the spices. Put 2 of the green peppers, a hot pepper, some garlic and the spices (mainly turmeric), and wine in a blender. #LABEL# -
